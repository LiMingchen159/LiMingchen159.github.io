abstract: With the growing need for precise campus electricity management, understanding
  load patterns is crucial for improving energy efficiency and optimizing energy use.
  However, detailed electricity load data for campus buildings and their internal
  equipment is often lacking, hindering research. This paper introduces an energy
  consumption monitoring dataset from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
  (HKUST) campus in Hong Kong, comprising data from over 1400 meters across more than
  20 buildings and collected over two and a half years. Using the Brick Schema curation
  strategy, raw data was curated into a research-ready format. This dataset supports
  various research tasks, including load pattern recognition, fault detection, demand
  response strategies, and load forecasting.
