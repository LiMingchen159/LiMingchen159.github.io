abstract: The number of studies considering building performance optimization   (BPO) in the building design phase is steadily growing, but many of the   existing studies do not consider the applicability of many-objective   optimization algorithms when increasing the objective dimensions. This article   first compares the NSGA-II, IDBEA, MSOPS-II, and NSGA-III algorithms. Then,   the algorithm most suitable for many-objective optimization is combined with   Artificial natural network(ANN) and TOPSIS-AHP to complete the optimization of   four dimensions of building energy consumption (EC), useful daylight   illuminance (UDI), comfort time ratio (CTR) and energy-saving envelope cost   (ESEC) for village houses in cold regions of China. The results show that the   NSGA-III algorithm performs well in terms of convergence speed, convergence,   diversity, and uniformity when solving many-objective problems compared to the   other three algorithms. Finally, four optimization strategies were selected   using the TOPSIS-AHP method.
