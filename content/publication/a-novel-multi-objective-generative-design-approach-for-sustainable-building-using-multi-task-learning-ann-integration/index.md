abstract: Building Performance Optimization (BPO) plays a pivotal role in   enhancing building performance, guaranteeing comfort while reducing resource   consumption. Existing performance-driven generative design is computational   demanding and difficult to be generalized to other similar buildings with   difficult to be generalized to other building types or climate conditions. To   fill this gap, this paper introduces a novel framework, which integrates   multitask learning (MTL), code compliance check, and multi-objective   optimization through NSGA-III algorithm. This framework is able to identify   Paratoo Optimal design solutions, which comply with building codes, at low   computation costs. The framework begins with selecting key design variables   that are critical to building energy, comfort performance and life cycle cost.   It then employs MTL to enhance the model's accuracy while reducing   computational costs. Next, we designed a code compliance checking module   followed by the NSGA-III optimization process, with the objective of   identifying solutions that comply with existing building codes. The results   indicate that the proposed MTL network achieved an R2 score of 0.983â€“0.993 on   the test set. In the particular case study where equal weights are preferred,   this approach yielded noteworthy reductions of 27.65%, 19.55%, and 31.13% in   Building Energy Consumption (BEC), Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and Residue of   continuous Daylight Autonomy (RcDA), respectively, for a rural dwelling, and   exclude solutions that fail to satisfy regulatory standards. This framework   allows designer to input the weights of each objective based on their   preference and can be applied to other building types and climate regions.   Last, we develop a solution selection tool based on the results output by the   framework we proposed, which can be found at   https://github.com/LiMingchen159/Village-House-Design-Strategy-in-Hebei-Province-China.
