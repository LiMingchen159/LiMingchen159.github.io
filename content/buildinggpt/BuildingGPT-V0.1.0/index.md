# About BuildingGPT
BuildingGPT is a cutting-edge solution designed to bridge the gap between building data and natural language processing. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and semantic data integration techniques, it enables intuitive querying and advanced analysis of building performance data.

## Key Features and Updates: 
- **Semantic Data Querying via Natural Language::** 
BuildingGPT introduces a streamlined method for retrieving information from semantic models using natural language requests. This approach eliminates the need for complex query languages, making data more accessible to a broader range of users.

- **Synthetic Data Evaluation Framework:**
The platform provides a new evaluation framework based on synthetic data. This methodology enables consistent, repeatable assessments of model performance, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the system under various scenarios.

- **Basic Front-End Implementation:**
BuildingGPT features an intuitive, easy-to-navigate front-end interface. This initial implementation focuses on core usability, allowing users to issue queries, visualize results, and explore data without technical barriers.
