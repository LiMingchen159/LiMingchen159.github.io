## About BuildingGPT
BuildingGPT is a cutting-edge solution designed to bridge the gap between building data and natural language processing. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and semantic data integration techniques, it enables intuitive querying and advanced analysis of building performance data.

## Key Features and Updates: 

- **Added Project Management Functionality:**
Users can seamlessly switch between different conversations and projects without losing context.

- **Introduced BIM Model Visualization:**
The system now supports natural language interaction with BIM models, providing a more intuitive way to query and navigate building information directly from the model.

- **Improved Front-End Development:**
The front-end interface has been refined to offer a smoother, more user-friendly experience, enabling easier access to all functionalities.
