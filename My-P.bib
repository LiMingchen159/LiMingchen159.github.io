  abstract = {The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors and past thermal history modify building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current ASHRAE comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the ASHRAE RP-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted mean vote (PMV) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in HVAC buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an integrated system that automatically provides detailed as-is semantic 3D models of buildings. The system is able to explore and reconstruct large scenes at a high level of detail, passing through five semantic levels, finally generating a detailed semantic model of the building. Our autonomous scanning platform collects raw data regarding the scene. At the first level of modelling, our autonomous scanning platform collects data regarding the scene and generates a point cloud that is later structured in a semantic point cloud model containing indoor, clutter and outlier point clouds. The second and third levels of semantic models consist of a simple B-rep representation and a model of basic building components, which includes the walls, ceiling, floor and columns, as well as their topology. Openings are then added, thus yielding our fourth semantic model. Finally, small components in buildings, such as sockets, switches, lights and others are recognised, resulting in the fifth semantic model. This approach has been tested on real data of building floors using our Mobile Platform for Autonomous Digitization (MoPAD). To the authors' knowledge this is the first work that, after obtaining 3D data with an autonomous mobile scanning platform, achieves such detailed modelling of building interiors. The performance of the method has been assessed quantitatively against ground truth on simulated and real environments. Two videos are available at the Supplementary material of this paper.},

The findings also revealed unique features of DT and BC, potentially supporting the proposal for their collaborative implementation to enhance building lifecycle management. This review's findings positioned the argument for more research on integrating DT and BC to augment building lifecycle management and the need to explore their relevance or role when transitioning from construction to post-construction.

  abstract = {Abstract   ``Framework'' and ``case-study'' are the two most prominent features in the optimization of architectural building design. The first can improve the speed of the process, the accuracy and integration of the outcome. The second can evolve the design knowledge of the various types of buildings in practice. This paper presents the ``PCA-ANN integrated NSGA-III'' framework that is a fast, accurate, and integrated solution for practical, erosive, and complicated building performance optimization problems, especially when the case study is a multi-type building such as a dormitory. The novelty and contribution of this paper exist in all three phases of its research framework. First, the dormitory building was parametrically modeled as a case study in two conventional dormitory building types. Second, an artificial model called PCA-ANN is presented in which problems that have a more complicated and practical case study with a multi-type building can be solved simply, integratively, and accurately. Third, the capabilities of NSGA-III are introduced and showed that it could be more accurate in comparison with NSGA-II, and then NSGA-III was integrated with the PCA-ANN model to solve the many-objective problem posed in this study. R2 score for PCA-ANN in the best-presented structure reached 0.99. In the overall best building alternative, energy efficiency and daylight performance for the whole year and thermal comfort performance in the free running period improved by 41.27\%, 42.24\%, and 15.57\%, respectively, compared to its reference model. The presented framework can be applied and generalized to building energy optimization problems in practical and complex cases.},

The proposed treatment modifies the distribution characteristics of the data set. The prediction of the suspended sediment, which is an important problem in river engineering applications, will be considered as a case study. Conventional approaches lack in providing high accuracy due to the inherently employed simplicity in order to obtain empirical formulae. On the other hand, artificial neural networks are able to model the non-linear characteristics of the mechanism of the sediment transport and have a growing body of applications in diverse applications in civil engineering. It will be shown that a significant enhancement and superior score in accuracy, compared with the classical approaches, are obtainable when the proposed treatment is employed. The proposed technique is an extension to the understanding of the practical aspects of neural computing applications. Therefore the outcome of the present study is important as it is applicable to any scenario where neural network approaches are involved.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs), usually simply called neural networks (NNs), are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron receives signals then processes them and can signal neurons connected to it. The "signal" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.},

A genetic algorithm (GA) is implemented by means of the coupling between MATLAB{\textregistered} and EnergyPlus to minimize primary energy consumption (PEC), energy-related global cost (GC) and discomfort hours (DH). The design variables concern the set point temperatures, the radiative properties of plasters, the thermo-physical properties of envelope components, the window type, the building orientation. The GA performs a Pareto optimization and finally two optimal solutions are recommended: the nZEB (nearly zero energy building) optimal solution, which minimizes PEC, and the cost-optimal solution, which minimizes GC. These solutions provide the optimal design strategies for the public and private stakeholders, respectively, which represent the main actors involved in building design. The approach is applied for the design of a new typical Italian residential building. Four locations are considered to investigate the typical Italian climates. The outcomes can give precious indications to rebuild the Italian residential stock with a view to energy-efficiency and cost-optimality, given that the optimal solutions provide low values of PEC -- between 62.0 and 91.9 kWhp/m2a -- and of GC -- between 456 and 665 {\texteuro}/m2 -- depending on the location.},

  abstract = {Because the building sector has become a huge energy consumer, providing useful approaches can help tackle this important issue. Windows are an important component of a building since most of the natural light inside the building is provided by passing this component. Improper design of windows and their associated components, such as shadings, overheats the space and increases energy consumption, and on the other hand, disturbs the visual and thermal comfort of the building's occupants. The present paper aims to present a new approach for multi-objective optimization of the architectural specifications and control parameters of a smart shadow curtain. The use of this proposed approach leads to a significant reduction in building energy consumption and improved thermal and visual comfort. Energy-related simulations are performed through EnergyPlus software. Afterward, 21 design variables including control strategies and setpoints, location and orientation of shading, slat dimensions and material specifications, as well as hourly slat angle are considered in JEPLUS software. These simulations are conducted in four geographical directions over seasonal and annual periods for the city of Tehran, Iran. JEPLUS~+~EA software is employed to perform sensitivity analysis on the outputs of JEPLUS software and data optimization. Morris sensitivity analysis is implemented to investigate the effects of input variables on the objective functions. The NSGA-II algorithm is then applied to optimize the data to extract the optimal points on a Pareto front. The optimization results indicate that the external blind performs better than the internal blind and also the smaller the angle of the blind slat is, the better the visual comfort is but increases the electricity consumption for lighting. A comparison of the results of multi-objective optimization of controlled blind characteristics with initial values demonstrates that based on geographical directions, the total energy consumption of the entire building decreases by a range of 40--50~\% per year, while visual comfort and thermal comfort are improved by ranges of 70--100~\% and 10--40~\%, respectively.},

Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and the relationships between them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight unmodified energy efficiency applications on these buildings.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the massive development of digital technologies for capturing data from sensors, located both in-side buildings and in the urban environment, made necessary an expansion of the traditional semantic domains of the construction industry with reference to BIM-based information management processes. The integration of data between BIM models and IoT devices enables the creation of Digital Twins (DTs) of built heritage assets, capable of connecting data coming continuously from sensors with digital models of those assets. This enables the management of large masses of data produced at various stages of the building lifecycle, making it possible to experiment with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics for predictive analysis of building system behavior and performance. This paper presents the results of a research, which aimed to develop a methodological and operational workflow for the creation of Digital Twin of buildings. The interoperability offered by the IFC schema allowed the use of an external platform for linking different semantic fields. Thus, on the one hand, a federated BIM model was created, and on the other hand, real-time acquired data from a system of sensors in-stalled at different locations in the building were recorded and stored in a central server.},

In order to obtain uniformly distributed set of Pareto-optimal points, the objectives must be normalized so that any distance metric computation in the objective space is meaningful. Thus, normalization becomes a crucial component of an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithm. In this paper, we investigate and discuss the normalization procedure for NSGA-III, a state-of-the-art multi- and many-objective evolutionary algorithm. First, we show the importance of normalization in higher-dimensional objective spaces. Second, we provide pseudo-codes which presents a clear description of normalization methods proposed in this study. Third, we compare the proposed normalization methods on a variety of test problems up~to ten objectives. The results indicate the importance of normalization for the overall algorithm performance and show the effectiveness of the originally proposed NSGA-III's hyperplane concept in higher-dimensional objective spaces.},

  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a promising technique to address growing needs for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to operate more efficiently and with greater flexibility. However, due to a number of factors, including the required implementation expertise, lack of high quality data, and a risk-adverse industry, MPC has yet to gain widespread adoption. While many previous studies have shown the advantages of MPC, few analyzed the implementation effort and associated practical challenges. In addition, previous work has developed an open-source, Modelica-based tool-chain that automatically generates optimal control, parameter estimation, and state estimation problems aimed at facilitating MPC implementation. Therefore, this study demonstrates usage of this tool-chain to implement MPC in a real office building, discusses practical challenges of implementing MPC, and estimates the implementation effort associated with various tasks in order to inform the development of future workflows and serve as an initial benchmark for their impact on reducing implementation effort. This study finds that the implemented MPC saves approximately 40\% of HVAC energy over the existing control during a two-month trial period and that tasks related to data collection and controller deployment activities can each require as much effort as model generation.},

Advances in computational tools for design applications, coupled with techniques from the field of artificial intelligence, have lead to new possibilities in the way computers can inform and actively interact with the design process.In this paper, we use the concepts of generative and goal-oriented design to propose a computer tool that can help the designer to generate and evaluate certain aspects of a solution towards an optimized behavior of the final configuration. This work focuses mostly on those aspects related to the environmental performance of buildings.Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are applied as a generative and search procedure to look for optimized design solutions in terms of thermal and lighting performance in a building. The GA is first used to generate possible design solutions, which are then evaluated in terms of lighting and thermal behavior using a detailed thermal analysis program (DOE2.1E). The results from the simulations are subsequently used to further guide the GA search towards finding low-energy solutions to the problem under study. Solutions can be visualized using an AutoLisp routine.The specific problem addressed in this study is the placing and sizing of windows in an office building. The same method is applicable to a wide range of design problems like the choice of construction materials, design of shading elements, or sizing of lighting and mechanical systems for buildings.},

The quality of their results mainly depends on thermal models and input data. Having accurate data about properties and operation conditions of buildings is difficult. In consequence, simulation inputs are affected by uncertainties that may have significant effects on outputs and are important to be considered. Law-driven detailed models are widely used. They ensure reliability and versatility but require a large number of input parameters. The paper addresses the difficulties of getting information from SA using detailed models with existing techniques and proposes a methodology which solves current problems. The methodology consists of using a detailed model of the building, defining and propagating uncertainties of input parameters, calculating macroparameters that characterize the building and getting sensitivity indices. The procedure is applied to the study case of a dwelling in which weather and occupancy are found out to be the strongest parameters on its annual consumption. It should be highlighted that, keeping the structure of inputs with uncertainties required by complex models that defines buildings in detail, the method eases building performance understanding.},

  abstract = {The efficient management of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in smart buildings is one of the main applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. In this paper we propose an IoT based architecture for the implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC) of HVAC systems in real environments. The considered MPC algorithm optimizes on line, in a closed-loop control fashion, both the indoor thermal comfort and the related energy consumption for a single zone environment. Thanks to the proposed IoT based architecture, the sensing, control, and actuating subsystems are all connected to the Internet, and a remote interface with the HVAC control system is guaranteed to end-users. In particular, sensors and actuators communicate with a remote database server and a control unit, which provides the control actions to be actuated in the HVAC system; users can set remotely the control mode and related set-points of the system; while comfort and environmental indices are transferred via the Internet and displayed on the end-users' interface. The proposed IoT based control architecture is implemented and tested in a campus building at the Polytechnic of Bari (Italy) in a proof of concept perspective. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is assessed in the real environment evaluating both the thermal comfort results and the energy savings with respect to a classical thermostat regulation approach.},

  abstract = {The process of building design is currently undergoing some major changes. In an attempt to mitigate climate change, the design of more sustainable buildings is advocated by the UK government. Furthermore, standalone design methods are being replaced with the concept of Building Information Modelling (BIM). The adoption of BIM has been documented to result in many benefits, which range from time to cost savings. During the initial planning stages, building performance simulation (BPS) can be used to inform design decisions. Data can be exchanged between BIM and BPS tools using data transfer schemas such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The IFC schema lacks an energy domain, and as a result, an extension is proposed in this paper. This contains energy concepts from a BPS tool called Passive House Planning Package (PHPP). The extended schema was developed by way of an externally coupled Java tool, which facilitates the transfer of data, and informs the building design decision-making process. The process of geometry extraction has been validated with several case studies, which are based on certified Passivhaus buildings in Hannover Kronsberg, Germany and Ebbw Vale, Wales. The amount of error is acceptable, and it is mostly due to differences in the initial BIM model setup, not due to the processing of IFC files.},

Energy management systems can prevent energy wastage in buildings without sacrificing occupant's comfort. However, their full capabilities have not been completely realized, partly due to their inability to quickly detect faults in HVAC systems. An accurate model and an appropriate threshold are the key factors in fault detection. The traditional method of setting a fixed threshold often leads to missed opportunities to detect faults, delayed detection of faults or false alarms. To improve the effectiveness of fault detection algorithms, we have first developed a data-driven model using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). We have then applied the proposed dynamic threshold method to determine occurrences of faults in real time. This method adjusts the threshold value dynamically according to the real-time moving average and moving standard deviation of the predictions. The results demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method to detect faults early in the course. An average increase of 8.82\% and 117.65\%, in the F1 score, is achieved with the proposed method in comparison to the traditional fixed threshold method and an existing dynamic residual method.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes an algorithm for coordinated control of the distributed generators integrated to a DC microgrid (DCMG), in islanded and grid connected modes of operation. The proposed DCMG connects photovoltaic (PV) panels, energy storage (i.e. battery bank and hybrid vehicle) and public utility access to supply the load of a house. The integration of distributed sources with DCMG depends on their feed in tariff (i.e low feed in tariff high integration priority). Moreover the microgrid electricity price is the function of feed in tariff of a power source, and their power feed in the DCMG. Therefore, DCMG prices are dynamic. The non energy storable appliance (NESA) and energy storable appliance (ESA) control algorithm has been proposed for load controlling. The electricity price is one of the parameter for ESA control algorithm. The ESA control algorithm shifts the operating time of energy storable appliances without affecting the user comfort to optimize the electricity bill with the same amount of energy consumption. The control action of NESA control algorithm depends on the occupant presence and other parameters such as illumination, temperature in the house. So the NESA control algorithm reduces the energy consumption in the house as well as cost of the energy. The SCADA system is used to interface with the smart sensors of the house and to execute the NESA and ESA control algorithms to switch the appliances. The results from a case study of a home in Alinagar (India) is presented in this paper in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of the load control system and to analyses the luminous, and temperature conditions and occupancy obtained through the application of this technology. The environmental and energy performances, together with the degree of users' satisfaction and acceptance of this control system, were analysed for a day to verify the potentiality and operation of this load control system. The obtained results regarding the potential in savings of energy (31\%) and electricity bill (35\%) were evaluated taking into account both the monitored annual electric energy consumption (for operation) and the parasitic energy consumption due to the installed devices (sensors and controllers), and were compared with the estimated energy consumption with manual load control.},

  abstract = {Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter \${\textbackslash}alpha\$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.},

  abstract = {The building envelope performance significantly influences the building energy consumption, and the major influencing factors of the building envelope include the external wall U-value, external wall solar absorptance, roof U-value, roof solar absorptance, external window U-value, and window-to-wall ratio. This paper proposed a framework that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with LSSVM (least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to study the influence of building envelope parameters on building energy consumption and discover the best design. The DesignBuilder (DB) is used to perform energy consumption simulation and orthogonal experiment to obtain the sample data set. The LSSVM is utilized to learn the data set to establish a prediction model between the building envelope and energy consumption, which is used as the fitness function of the building energy consumption in NSGA-II. With the objective of minimizing building energy consumption and maximizing the indoor thermal comfort (measured by predicted mean vote or PMV), an NSGA-II multi-objective optimization model is established. The Pareto front is obtained through calculation, and the optimal combination of building envelope parameters is discovered using the ideal point method. A case of a proposed school building in China is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed framework, the results show that: (1) The LSSVM has great ability to predict building energy consumption, achieving an accurate prediction with a goodness-of-fit of 0.9549 and an RMSE of 0.0273; (2) The optimized envelope design parameters of the proposed building are presented, including the External wall U-value is 0.2, the External wall solar absorptance is 0.55, the Roof U-value is 0.2, the External window U-value is 0.4166, the External window U-value is 1, the Window-wall ratio is 0.215. (3) The developed LSSVM-NSGA II hybrid approach can effectively improve the building's energy consumption and thermal comfort with the building energy consumption reduced by 10.6\% and the thermal comfort increased by 32.2\% than the initial values, respectively. The proposed LSSVM-NSGA II framework is able to optimize building envelope design parameters than its precedent, which can provide effective thinking for similar problems.},

  abstract = {This research proposed an integrated strategy for building performance optimization from the whole life cycle perspective to explore the optimal building scheme. After the feature elimination, the ensemble learning model (ELM) was trained to obtain a high-precision model for predicting life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE), life cycle costs (LCC), and indoor discomfort hours (IDH). Then, the optimal optimization algorithm was selected among three different optimization algorithms. Finally, the best building scheme was chosen according to the newly proposed solution. The results showed that the ELM could achieve high prediction efficiency by combining input feature evaluation and screening, multi-sampling methods, and hyperparameter optimization. The R2 value of ELM can reach 0.980, while the Two-Archive Evolutionary Algorithm for Constrained multi-objective optimization (C-TAEA) was the optimal optimization algorithm. The best equilibrium solution proposed in this study solved the problem of different optimization ranges of different objectives and maximized the optimization value. Finally, the best equilibrium scheme reduced the LCCE by 34.7\%, the LCC by 13.9\%, and the IDH by 26.6\%. Therefore, this strategy can efficiently optimize building objectives and produce a more balanced and optimal building scheme, thus making it widely applicable in building performance optimization.},

In this paper, data-driven FDD is defined as those that are built or trained from data via machine learning or multivariate statistical analysis methods. Following this definition, this paper reviews and summarizes the literature on data-driven FDD from three aspects: process, systems studied (including the systems being investigated, the faults being identified, and the associated data sources), and evaluation metrics. A data-driven FDD process is further divided into the following steps: data collection, data cleansing, data preprocessing, baseline establishment, fault detection, fault diagnostics, and potential fault prognostics. Literature reported data-driven methods used in each step of an FDD process are firstly discussed. Applications of data-driven FDD in various HVAC systems/components and commonly used data source for FDD development are reviewed secondly, followed by a summary of typical metrics for evaluating FDD methods. Finally, this literature review concludes that despite the promising performance reported in the literature, data-driven FDD methods still face many challenges, such as real-building deployment, performance evaluation and benchmarking, scalability and transferability, interpretability, cyber security and data privacy, user experience, etc. Addressing these challenges is critical for a broad real-building adoption of data-driven FDD.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control is widely used as a control technology for the computation of optimal control inputs of building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, both the benefits and widespread adoption of model predictive control (MPC) are hindered by the effort of model creation, calibration, and accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we apply the data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) algorithm for designing controls for building HVAC systems. The algorithm solely depends on input/output data from the system to predict future state trajectories without the need for system identification. The algorithm relies on the idea that a vector space of all input--output trajectories of a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system is spanned by time-shifts of a single measured trajectory, given the input signal is persistently exciting. Closed-loop simulations using EnergyPlus are performed to demonstrate the approach. The simulated building modeled in EnergyPlus is a modified commercial large office prototype building served by an air handling unit-variable air volume HVAC system. Temperature setpoints of zones are used as control variables to minimize the HVAC energy cost of the building considering a time-of-use electricity rate structure. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is conducted to gain insights into the effect of parameter tuning on DeePC performance. Simulation results are used to illustrate the performance of the algorithm and compare the algorithm with model-based MPC and occupancy-based setpoint controller. Overall, DeePC achieves similar performance compared to MPC for lower engineering effort.},

  abstract = {We present the AgreementMaker system for matching real-world schemas and ontologies, which may consist of hundreds or even thousands of concepts. The end users of the system are sophisticated domain experts whose needs have driven the design and implementation of the system: they require a responsive, powerful, and extensible framework to perform, evaluate, and compare matching methods. The system comprises a wide range of matching methods addressing different levels of granularity of the components being matched (conceptual vs. structural), the amount of user intervention that they require (manual vs. automatic), their usage (stand-alone vs. composed), and the types of components to consider (schema only or schema and instances). Performance measurements (recall, precision, and runtime) are supported by the system, along with the weighted combination of the results provided by those methods. The AgreementMaker has been used and tested in practical applications and in the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) competition. We report here on some of its most advanced features, including its extensible architecture that facilitates the integration and performance tuning of a variety of matching methods, its capability to evaluate, compare, and combine matching results, and its user interface with a control panel that drives all the matching methods and evaluation strategies.},

  abstract = {Multi-objective optimization problems are difficult to solve in that the optimized objectives are usually conflicting with each other. It is usually hard to find an optimal solution that satisfies all objectives from the mathematical point of view. Unlike analytical methods and classical numerical methods, which require strict mathematical calculation or defined initial search values, intelligent optimization algorithms are heuristic algorithms able to find global optimal solutions. In this paper, we make a brief introduction of multi-objective optimization problems and some state-of-the-art intelligent algorithms. In order to get the final optimal solution in the real-world multi-objective optimization problems, trade-off methods including a priori methods, interactive methods, Pareto-dominated methods and new dominance methods are utilized. Moreover, we give a review of multi-objective optimization methods application in the environmental protection fields, for optimization objectives of energy saving, emissions reduction and cost reduction, etc. At last, a whole summary about current difficulties existed in the multi-objective optimization problem is given out, serving as suggestions or guidance for future researches.

  abstract = {The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm in the built environment by drawing inspiration from existing DT research in manufacturing. The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors.},

  abstract = {MuItiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that use nondominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for their: 1) O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); 2) nonelitism approach; and 3) the need for specifying a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a nondominated sorting-based multiobjective EA (MOEA), called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm Il (NSGA-II). which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast nondominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread) N solutions. Simulation results on difficult test problems show that the proposed NSGA-II, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to Pareto-archived evolution strategy and strength-Pareto EA-two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multiobjective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained muItiobjective optimizer and much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

  abstract = {In Machine Learning, the most common way to address a given problem is to optimize an error measure by training a single model to solve the desired task. However, sometimes it is possible to exploit latent information from other related tasks to improve the performance of the main one, resulting in a learning paradigm known as Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In this context, the high computational capacity of deep neural networks (DNN) can be combined with the improved generalization performance of MTL, by designing independent output layers for every task and including a shared representation for them. In this paper we exploit this theoretical framework on a problem related to Wind Power Ramps Events (WPREs) prediction in wind farms. Wind energy is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, with potential global spreading and deep penetration in developed and developing countries. One of the main issues with the majority of renewable energy resources is their intrinsic intermittency, which makes it difficult to increase the penetration of these technologies into the energetic mix. In this case, we focus on the specific problem of WPREs prediction, which deeply affect the wind speed and power prediction, and they are also related to different turbines damages. Specifically, we exploit the fact that WPREs are spatially-related events, in such a way that predicting the occurrence of WPREs in different wind farms can be taken as related tasks, even when the wind farms are far away from each other. We propose a DNN-MTL architecture, receiving inputs from all the wind farms at the same time to predict WPREs simultaneously in each of the farms locations. The architecture includes some shared layers to learn a common representation for the information from all the wind farms, and it also includes some specification layers, which refine the representation to match the specific characteristics of each location. Finally we modified the Adam optimization algorithm for dealing with imbalanced data, adding costs which are updated dynamically depending on the worst classified class. We compare the proposal against a baseline approach based on building three different independent models (one for each wind farm considered), and against a state-of-the-art reservoir computing approach. The DNN-MTL proposal achieves very good performance in WPREs prediction, obtaining a good balance for all the classes included in the problem (negative ramp, no ramp and positive ramp).},

  abstract = {The TOPSIS method is a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution. This technique currently is one of the most popular methods for Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). The TOPSIS method was primary developed for dealing with only real-valued data. In many cases, it is hard to present precisely the exact ratings of alternatives with respect to local criteria and as a result these ratings are considered as intervals. There are some papers devoted to the interval extensions of TOPSIS method, but these extensions are based on different heuristic approaches to definition of positive and negative ideal solutions. These ideal solutions are presented by real values or intervals, which are not attainable in a decision matrix. Since this is in contradiction with basics of classical TOPSIS method, in this paper we propose a new direct approach to interval extension of TOPSIS method which is free of heuristic assumptions and limitations of known methods. Using numerical examples we show that ``direct interval extension of TOPSIS method'' may provide the final ranking of alternatives which is substantially different from the results obtained using known methods.},

The roof was divided into three portions, one, the bare roof, representing the reference case without PCMs, the other two integrating two PCM's typologies with different melting/solidification temperatures range. A numerical model was furthermore developed implementing the equivalent capacitance numerical method to describe the substance phase transition and the measured data set were used for its validation. The study demonstrates that PCM-enhanced components are a promising solution toward a higher thermal performance efficiency in roof attic spaces during the summer season. Experimental results showed a reduction of the ongoing heat peak load between 13\% and 59\% depending on the PCM typology, highlighting that to reach the expected performance the proper PCM type should be carefully selected.},

These buildings can utilize current and historical data, collected from occupancy detection and monitoring networks, to predict occupancy profiles and adjust heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) operations accordingly. This adjustment aims to minimize the energy consumption of HVAC systems while maintaining an acceptable level of thermal comfort and indoor air quality. To provide a trade-off between these conflicting objectives, a variety of occupancy-based control strategies have been proposed in the literature. The present article aims to review the research works concerning occupancy-based control systems, classify them based on the integration of occupancy information with control systems and identify their strengths and limitations. Finally, research gaps in this field are discussed from different aspects, including performance evaluation metrics, control methods, occupancy models and buildings types. Future research directions are also proposed to fill the identified gaps.},

The aim is to find the cost-optimal level for the French single-family building typology, while providing an effective method to deal with a huge number of simulations corresponding to a large number of building configurations. The method combines the use of TRNSYS, dynamic energy simulation software, with GenOpt, Generic Optimization program. The building that was taken as a reference is a real low-consumption house located in Amberieu-en-Bugey, Rhone-Alpes, France. The model was created and calibrated in TRNSYS and the energy efficiency measures, concerning different technologies for envelope systems and technical systems, were set up as parameters in GenOpt. After a research on the French market, a cost function was created for each parameter and the global cost function (EN15459 Standard) was taken as objective function for the optimization. The particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to minimize the objective function and find the cost-optimal building configuration within the current regulatory framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) have been considered as an important asset to support the power grid reliability by utilizing the demand flexibility offered by GEBs. GEBs are enabled by advances in sensors and controls, and the communication between building equipment, whole buildings, and the grid. The integration of different building technologies and network-based communication system makes GEBs vulnerable to passive threats such as equipment failure and active threats such as cyber-attacks. Modeling and simulation is an effective way to evaluate the impact of threats on the system performance. This paper proposes a generic and flexible threat injection framework for commonly-used building energy simulators such as EnergyPlus and Modelica to support threat modeling and evaluation. This framework leverages functional mock-up unit (FMU) to develop a general modeling interface for threat injection and simulation. A numerical case study using Modelica as a building energy simulator is conducted to demonstrate the capability of the framework for supporting single/multiple-order threat modeling and simulation of a GEB. Four threats and their combinations are injected on a Modelica-based threat-free building energy and control system, including operating supply fan at its full speed, remotely cycling the chiller on and off, blocking the chiller from receiving the chilled water supply temperature setpoints, and hijacking the global zone air temperature setpoint. Simulation results show that the cyber-attack that leads to short-term signal blocking has small effects on the system operation due to the ``self-healing'' feature of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) interactive control system. The threat that takes control of resetting the global zone air temperature setpoints has the most adverse impact on the system energy use, peak power demand, thermal comfort and the provision of demand flexibility. The combination of four threats have aggregative effects on the system but the effects are less than the additive effects of the individual threat.},

  abstract = {Building Information modeling (BIM) has the potential to advance and transform facilities Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) by providing a platform for facility managers to retrieve, analyze, and process building information in a digitalized 3D environment. Currently, because of rapid developments in BIM, researchers and industry professionals need a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in facility O\&M. This paper presents a review of recent publications on the topic. It aims to evaluate and summarize the current BIM-O\&M research and application developments from a facility manager's point of view, analyze research trends, and identify research gaps and promising future research directions. The scope of this research includes the academic articles, industry reports and guidelines pertaining to using BIM to improve selected facility O\&M activities, including maintenance and repair, emergency management, energy management, change/relocation management, and security. The content analysis results show that research on BIM for O\&M is still in its early stage and most of the current research has focused on energy management. We have identified that the interoperability in the BIM-O\&M context is still a challenge and adopting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Framework is a potential starting point to address this issue. More studies involving surveys are needed to understand the underlying O\&M principles for BIM implementation -- data requirements, areas of inefficiencies, the process changes. In addition, more studies on the return on investment of the innovative systems are required to justify the value of BIM-O\&M applications and an improved Life Cycle Cost Analysis method is critical for such justifications.},

The method of using building information modelling for the building energy modelling process, named building information modelling-based building energy modelling has become a prevalent and attractive topic in both the research and the industry society in recent years. This paper presents an overall review on the building design process, and applications of building information modelling and building energy modelling in the design process. It also provides an in-depth review on the development of building information modelling-based building energy modelling methods and the development of prevalent informational infrastructures. Meanwhile, this literature review provides a special consideration on the maturity of building data transformation between building information modelling and building energy modelling for building energy simulation process, from the step 1 identifying the geometry, thermal properties of buildings to the step 6 the information and components for HVAC systems. In general, the current building information modelling-based building energy modelling methods are thoroughly evaluated and the trends for future developments are outlined. It is realised that the Building Information Modelling based Building Energy Modelling is particular appropriate for the early design stage, where the most suitable and cost effective approaches for energy efficient design can be integrated into the overall building design process.},

  abstract = {In the building context, there is a growing requirement for numerous data models and ontologies to coexist as a means to cover different perspectives and communities. While there are some well-known efforts, such as the Brick schema, to create an overall usable ontology, interlinking available ontologies and data models is still a challenge that can provide significant benefits towards interoperability of Building Information Models. To shed light on this matter, we provide a review of some of the most important ontologies in the building context, which we then match against Brick as a means to provide an interlinked data model. For finding matches, we propose TrioNet, an interactive ontology matcher utilizing weak supervision and active learning, which we compare in terms of precision and recall with two well-known state-of-the-art ontology matchers: AgreementMakerLight (AML) and LogMap. TrioNet outperforms them in finding more verified matches with only a few domain expert annotations, making it an ideal tool for the creation of interlinked data models to improve interoperability. With this paper, we contribute the following datasets: (i) the overall Brick data model interlinked to five other ontologies; (ii) the discovered pairwise ontology alignments; and (iii) the manually-annotated matches used for evaluation.},

  abstract = {The pervasive application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is transforming many industries and aspects of the human experience. One very important industry trend is the move to convert existing human dwellings to smart buildings, and to create new smart buildings. Smart buildings aim to mitigate climate change by reducing energy consumption and associated carbon emissions. To accomplish this, they leverage artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning algorithms to learn and optimize system performance. These fields of research are currently very rapidly evolving and advancing, but there has been very little guidance to help engineers and architects working on smart buildings apply artificial intelligence algorithms and technologies in a systematic and effective manner. In this paper we present B-SMART: the first reference architecture for autonomic smart buildings. B-SMART facilitates the application of artificial intelligence techniques and technologies to smart buildings by decoupling conceptually distinct layers of functionality and organizing them into an autonomic control loop. We also present a case study illustrating how B-SMART can be applied to accelerate the introduction of artificial intelligence into an existing smart building.},

K-fold cross validation is used to improve the effectiveness of the model. The input data is taken from finite element (FE) peeling results. The neural network is trained with 75\% of the FE dataset. The remaining 25\% are utilized to predict the peeling behavior. The training performance is evaluated for every change in the number of hidden layer neurons to determine the optimal network structure. The relative error is calculated to draw a clear comparison between predicted and FE results. It is shown that the BR-BPNN model in conjunction with k-fold technique has significant potential to estimate the peeling behavior.},

  abstract = {Several variants of the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ( {\textbackslash}approx 15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},

This article first compares the NSGA-II, IDBEA, MSOPS-II, and NSGA-III algorithms. Then, the algorithm most suitable for many-objective optimization is combined with Artificial natural network(ANN) and TOPSIS-AHP to complete the optimization of four dimensions of building energy consumption (EC), useful daylight illuminance (UDI), comfort time ratio (CTR) and energy-saving envelope cost (ESEC) for village houses in cold regions of China. The results show that the NSGA-III algorithm performs well in terms of convergence speed, convergence, diversity, and uniformity when solving many-objective problems compared to the other three algorithms. Finally, four optimization strategies were selected using the TOPSIS-AHP method.},

However, few studies on prefabricated buildings have been undertaken in this field. Meanwhile, the methodology used for achieving optimized solutions is still poor. In this paper, genetic algorithms and correlation analysis are employed and two parametric design methods---i.e., the floor plan generation method and the component selection method---are proposed for the modularity of the prefabricated buildings. Taking a typical high-rise building in Tianjin as an example, correlation analyses are performed on the basis of the two proposed methods to enhance the depth of the optimized finding approach. The outcome of this research demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed numerical approach, which can produce the optimized floor plan and construction set under the local conditions. This also reveals that the shape coefficient and window-to-wall ratio are strongly correlated with the energy performance of a building, which can help architects to pursue optimized design solutions in the schematic design process.},

The peak cooling and heating energy consumption, as well as the annual cooling and heating energy consumption of a substation in Shandong, are all simulated basing the Monte Carlo method. The simulation outputs are discussed by uncertainty analysis to obtain more accurate energy consumption thresholds. Subsequently, the treed Gaussian process and the standardized rank regression coefficient are used to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the simulation outputs. The results of the two global sensitivity analyses are practically the same, demonstrating that robustness can be ensured by simultaneously using two methods based on different theories. In addition, this study provides an efficient method for the energy-saving retrofitting of the existing substation and the energy-saving design of green substations in the future.},

For approach demonstration, a typical office building with multiple zones was utilized as testbed. The study 1) investigated the integrational effect of embedded PIR/CO2 sensors with a smart sensing network on occupancy detection/estimation; 2) field-monitored the energy benefits of an integrated smart sensing/control network in building-operations; and 3) examined the feasibility of further energy reduction via environmental system modeling. Two types of demonstration tests were performed under similar occupancy patterns and weather conditions; a) Baseline Test (3-day) with a normal building-operation following ASHRAE 62.1-2016 requirements, and b) Case Study (3-day) with a smart network-based demand control. Results showed substantial enhancements in occupancy accuracy and energy savings (up to 45\% of fan electricity and 36.5\% of room cooling/heating energy). The new approach provided satisfactory or similar levels of thermal comfort and IAQ. It was analyzed that the use of the environmental system modeling could further reduce the building-operational energy via more detailed control of ventilation.},

Energy flexibility of buildings can be an essential resource for a sustainable and reliable power grid with the growing variable renewable energy shares and the trend to electrify and decarbonize buildings. Traditional demand-side management technologies, advanced building controls, and emerging distributed energy resources (including electric vehicle, energy storage, and on-site power generation) enable the transition of the building stock to grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that operate efficiently to meet service needs and are responsive to grid pricing or carbon signals to achieve energy and carbon neutrality. Although energy flexibility has received growing attention from industry and the research community, there remains a lack of common ground for energy flexibility terminologies, characterization, and quantification methods. This paper presents a semantic ontology---EFOnt (Energy Flexibility Ontology)---that extends existing terminologies, ontologies, and schemas for building energy flexibility applications. EFOnt aims to serve as a standardized tool for knowledge co-development and streamlining energy flexibility related applications. We demonstrate potential use cases of EFOnt via two examples: ( 1 ) energy flexibility analytics with measured data from a residential smart thermostat dataset and a commercial building, and ( 2 ) modeling and simulation to evaluate energy flexibility of buildings. The compatibility of EFOnt with existing ontologies and the outlook of EFOnt's role in the building energy data tool ecosystem are discussed.},

However, few studies simultaneously optimize these parameters to determine the trade-off solutions between energy consumption, indoor daylighting, and thermal comfort. This study presents a multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework evaluating Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI), Energy Use Intensity (EUI), and Thermal Discomfort time Percentage (TDP) with a wide range of parameters to investigate the interactive relationships between multiple building design and performance parameters. The openable-window-area-ratio (OWR), window-wall-ratio (WWR), solar-heat-gain-coefficient (SHGC), louver depth, and wall thickness are integrated into the optimization process. Taking a building in the Hot Summer and Cold Winter Zone as an example, the results show that a large south-openable-window-area-ratio (OWRs), south-window-to-wall-ratio (WWRs), SHGC, and wall-thickness with a small north-window-wall-ratio (WWRn) and louver depth are most suitable for improving energy performance without sacrificing thermal and visual comfort. The trade-off solution represents noticeable improvements by 18\%, 48.4\%, and 2.5\%, respectively, compared with the initial solution in EUI, TDP for the transition seasons, and UDI. The outcomes help the architects to obtain an optimal solution for the design, refurbishment, and renovation of building envelopes in the HSCW zone towards the construction of sustainable cities. {$\bullet$} A multi-objective optimization framework proposed for the building envelope design. {$\bullet$} Quantified impacts of the openable window area ratio and window-to-wall ratio investigated. {$\bullet$} Quantified impacts of the solar heat gain coefficient, louver depth, and wall thickness investigated. {$\bullet$} Benefits of the trade-off solution on building envelope design in the HSCW zone analyzed.},

This is important to BTO's mission to enhance energy efficiency and save energy for economic and environmental purposes. For connected buildings ecosystems of products and services from various manufacturers to flourish, the ICT aspects of the equipment need to integrate and operate simply and reliably. Within the concepts of interoperability lie the specification, development, and certification of equipment with standards-based interfaces that connect and work. Beyond this, a healthy community of stakeholders that contribute to and use interoperability work products must be developed. On May 1, 2014, the DOE convened a technical meeting to take stock of the current state of interoperability of connected equipment and systems in buildings. Several insights from that meeting helped facilitate a draft description of the landscape of interoperability for connected buildings, which focuses mainly on small and medium commercial buildings. This document revises the February 2015 landscape document to address reviewer comments, incorporate important insights from the Buildings Interoperability Vision technical meeting, and capture thoughts from that meeting about the topics to be addressed in a buildings interoperability vision. In particular, greater attention is paid to the state of information modeling in buildings and the great potential for near-term benefits in this area from progress and community alignment.},

  abstract = {The challenge in Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) design is to find the best combination of design strategies that will face the energy performance problems of a particular building. This paper presents a methodology for the simulation-based multi-criteria optimization of NZEBs. Its main features include four steps: building simulation, optimization process, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and testing solution's robustness. The methodology is applied to investigate the cost-effectiveness potential for optimizing the design of NZEBs in different case studies taken as diverse climatic zones in Lebanon and France. The investigated design parameters include: external walls and roof insulation thickness, windows glazing type, cooling and heating set points, and window to wall ratio. Furthermore, the inspected RE systems include: solar domestic hot water (SDHW) and photovoltaic (PV) array. The proposed methodology is a useful tool to enhance NZEBs design and to facilitate decision making in early phases of building design. Specifically, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is chosen in order to minimize thermal, electrical demands and life cycle cost (LCC) while reaching the net zero energy balance; thus getting the Pareto-front. A ranking decision making technique Elimination and Choice Expressing the Reality (ELECTRE III) is applied to the Pareto-front so as to obtain one optimal solution.},

  abstract = {Schema evolution is the increasingly important ability to adapt deployed schemas to changing requirements. Effective support for schema evolution is challenging since schema changes may have to be propagated, correctly and efficiently, to instance data and dependent schemas, mappings, or applications. We introduce the major requirements for effective schema and ontology evolution, including support for a rich set of change operations, simplicity of change specification, evolution transparency (e.g., by providing and maintaining views or schema versions), automated generation of evolution mappings, and predictable instance migration that minimizes data loss and manual intervention. We then give an overview about the current state of the art and recent research results for the evolution of relational schemas, XML schemas, and ontologies. For numerous approaches, we outline how and to what degree they meet the introduced requirements.},

  abstract = {In theory, building automation and management systems (BAMSs) can provide all the components and functionalities required for analyzing and operating buildings. However, in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and air conditioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings' performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings' management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings' performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities. Lastly, future directions and valuable recommendations are identified to improve the performance and reliability of BAMSs in intelligent buildings.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new model to simulate energy performance of variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems in heat pump operation mode (either cooling or heating is provided but not simultaneously). The main improvement of the new model is the introduction of the evaporating and condensing temperature in the indoor and outdoor unit capacity modifier functions. The independent variables in the capacity modifier functions of the existing VRF model in EnergyPlus are mainly room wet-bulb temperature and outdoor dry-bulb temperature in cooling mode and room dry-bulb temperature and outdoor wet-bulb temperature in heating mode. The new approach allows compliance with different specifications of each indoor unit so that the modeling accuracy is improved. The new VRF model was implemented in a custom version of EnergyPlus 7.2. This paper first describes the algorithm for the new VRF model, which is then used to simulate the energy performance of a VRF system in a Prototype House in California that complies with the requirements of Title 24 ? the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards. The VRF system performance is then compared with three other types of HVAC systems: the Title 24-2005 Baseline system, the traditional High Efficiency system, and the EnergyStar Heat Pump system in three typical California climates: Sunnyvale, Pasadena and Fresno. Calculated energy savings from the VRF systems are significant. The HVAC site energy savings range from 51 to 85percent, while the TDV (Time Dependent Valuation) energy savings range from 31 to 66percent compared to the Title 24 Baseline Systems across the three climates. The largest energy savings are in Fresno climate followed by Sunnyvale and Pasadena. The paper discusses various characteristics of the VRF systems contributing to the energy savings. It should be noted that these savings are calculated using the Title 24 prototype House D under standard operating conditions. Actual performance of the VRF systems for real houses under real operating conditions will vary.},

  abstract = {Fueled by big data, powerful and affordable computing resources, and advanced algorithms, machine learning has been explored and applied to buildings research for the past decades and has demonstrated its potential to enhance building performance. This study systematically surveyed how machine learning has been applied at different stages of building life cycle. By conducting a literature search on the Web of Knowledge platform, we found 9579 papers in this field and selected 153 papers for an in-depth review. The number of published papers is increasing year by year, with a focus on building design, operation, and control. However, no study was found using machine learning in building commissioning. There are successful pilot studies on fault detection and diagnosis of HVAC equipment and systems, load prediction, energy baseline estimate, load shape clustering, occupancy prediction, and learning occupant behaviors and energy use patterns. None of the existing studies were adopted broadly by the building industry, due to common challenges including (1) lack of large scale labeled data to train and validate the model, (2) lack of model transferability, which limits a model trained with one data-rich building to be used in another building with limited data, (3) lack of strong justification of costs and benefits of deploying machine learning, and (4) the performance might not be reliable and robust for the stated goals, as the method might work for some buildings but could not be generalized to others. Findings from the study can inform future machine learning research to improve occupant comfort, energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience of buildings, as well as to inspire young researchers in the field to explore multidisciplinary approaches that integrate building science, computing science, data science, and social science.},

  abstract = {Numerous buildings fall short of expectations regarding occupant satisfaction, sustainability, or energy efficiency. In this paper, the performance of buildings in terms of occupant comfort is evaluated using a probabilistic model based on Bayesian networks (BNs). The BN model is founded on an in-depth analysis of satisfaction survey responses and a thorough study of building performance parameters. This study also presents a user-friendly visualization compatible with BIM to simplify data collecting in two case studies from Norway with data from 2019 to 2022. This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin approach for incorporating building information modeling (BIM) with real-time sensor data, occupants' feedback, a probabilistic model of occupants' comfort, and HVAC faults detection and prediction that may affect occupants' comfort. New methods for using BIM as a visualization platform, as well as a predictive maintenance method to detect and anticipate problems in the HVAC system, are also presented. These methods will help decision-makers improve the occupants' comfort conditions in buildings. However, due to the intricate interaction between numerous equipment and the absence of data integration among FM systems, CMMS, BMS, and BIM data are integrated in this paper into a framework utilizing ontology graphs to generalize the Digital Twin framework so it can be applied to many buildings. The results of this study can aid decision-makers in the facility management sector by offering insight into the aspects that influence occupant comfort, speeding up the process of identifying equipment malfunctions, and pointing toward possible solutions.},

All application areas are concerned, from theoretical physics to engineering and socio-economics. This introductory paper provides the sensitivity analysis aims and objectives in order to explain the composition of the overall ``Sensitivity Analysis'' chapter of the Springer Handbook. It also describes the basic principles of sensitivity analysis, some classification grids to understand the application ranges of each method, a useful software package, and the notations used in the chapter papers. This section also offers a succinct description of sensitivity auditing, a new discipline that tests the entire inferential chain including model development, implicit assumptions, and normative issues and which is recommended when the inference provided by the model needs to feed into a regulatory or policy process. For the ``Sensitivity Analysis'' chapter, in addition to this introduction, eight papers have been written by around twenty practitioners from different fields of application. They cover the most widely used methods for this subject: the deterministic methods as the local sensitivity analysis, the experimental design strategies, the sampling-based and variance-based methods developed from the 1980s, and the new importance measures and metamodel-based techniques established and studied since the 2000s. In each paper, toy examples or industrial applications illustrate their relevance and usefulness.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose the use of modified distance calculation in generational distance (GD) and inverted generational distance (IGD). These performance indicators evaluate the quality of an obtained solution set in comparison with a pre-specified reference point set. Both indicators are based on the distance between a solution and a reference point. The Euclidean distance in an objective space is usually used for distance calculation. Our idea is to take into account the dominance relation between a solution and a reference point when we calculate their distance. If a solution is dominated by a reference point, the Euclidean distance is used for their distance calculation with no modification. However, if they are non-dominated with each other, we calculate the minimum distance from the reference point to the dominated region by the solution. This distance can be viewed as an amount of the inferiority of the solution (i.e., the insufficiency of its objective values) in comparison with the reference point. We demonstrate using simple examples that some Pareto non-compliant results of GD and IGD are resolved by the modified distance calculation. We also show that IGD with the modified distance calculation is weakly Pareto compliant whereas the original IGD is Pareto non-compliant.},

  abstract = {Abstract Energy efficiency remains a significant topic in the control of building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, and diverse set of control strategies have been developed to optimize performance, including recently emerging techniques of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). While most existing works have focused on minimizing energy consumption, the generalization to energy cost minimization under time-varying electricity price profiles and demand charges has rarely been studied. Under these utility structures, significant cost savings can be achieved by pre-cooling buildings in the early morning when electricity is cheaper, thereby reducing expensive afternoon consumption and lowering peak demand. However, correctly identifying these savings requires planning horizons of one day or more. To tackle this problem, we develop Deep Q-Network (DQN) with an action processor, defining the environment as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with a reward function consisting of energy cost (time-of-use and peak demand charges) and a discomfort penalty, which is an extension of most reward functions used in existing DRL works in this area. Moreover, we develop a reward shaping technique to overcome the issue of reward sparsity caused by the demand charge. Through a single-zone building simulation platform, we demonstrate that the customized DQN outperforms the baseline rule-based policy, saving close to 6\% of total cost with demand charges, while close to 8\% without demand charges.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a thermal comfort model by incorporating public health datasets and influencing parameters associated with both health and thermal comfort. There are three systematic influencing parameters identified in this study: socioeconomic development, population density, and annual mean temperature. The thermal comfort neutral temperatures predicted with the new model are in good agreement with the measured field data, and the correlation coefficient is 0.91. The current study introduces large-scale spatial data and longitudinal health-temperature data from the public health field for contributing to thermal comfort research. For instance, the required numbers of intensive field experiments and modeling works regarding thermal comfort can be reduced. Moreover, studies on the impacts of certain factors (such as variations in time, gender, and age) on thermal comfort have not reached any conclusive results, mainly owing to a lack of large demographic datasets. Recent findings from the public health field indicate that there are observable variations in health-temperature data in response to climate changes. There are no significant health-temperature differences between genders, although females are more inclined to use resources for better environmental management. Other factors are also discussed in this study, such as age and the prevalence of air conditioners.},

  abstract = {A fire protection system takes on a critical significance to building operation. This paper describes the use of digital twins (DTs) and semantic web technologies for the intelligent control of building fire protection (BFP) systems in fire accidents. Specifically, a data fusion stage and several information-based control mechanisms are involved in the use of the two technologies. A designed BFP ontology is considered as the semantic model and basis of data fusion between the static building geometric information and the dynamic sensing data. The above information is incorporated into a DT data model, which is considered as the mapping of physical space. Moreover, rule models and process models are developed to achieve intelligent control mechanisms and keep the DT data model synced with the physical space. A case study based on a fire accident simulation was conducted to verify the feasibility of the use of DTs and semantic web technologies.},

  abstract = {There is a serious information gap between different life-cycle stages and different BIM platforms, semantic enrichment (SE) for BIM is an important solution to address this issue. Therefore, semantically rich BIM models are of great significance for efficient construction management and BIM is facing higher semantic requirements. It is necessary to conduct SE for BIM according to the requirements of specific domains. There is still a lack of in-depth analysis and summary of the content, methods, and applications of SE for BIM in different stages during the life cycle of facilities, therefore this paper gives a comprehensive review of SE for BIM to analyze the status quo and trends from content, methods, and applications. The content and four methods of SE for BIM are summarized. The pros, cons, and applicability of each method are analyzed. Applications of SE for BIM in the life cycle of facilities are discussed comprehensively. Finally, this paper discusses the enabling technologies, Level of Development (LOD) and SE for BIM, and presents research gaps and future directions.},

In contrast to most existing tools, LogMap also implements algorithms for `on the fly' unsatisfiability detection and repair. Our experiments with the ontologies NCI, FMA and SNOMED CT confirm that our system can efficiently match even the largest existing bio-medical ontologies. Furthermore, LogMap is able to produce a `clean' set of output mappings in many cases, in the sense that the ontology obtained by integrating LogMap's output mappings with the input ontologies is consistent and does not contain unsatisfiable classes.},

Building management systems aid in improving occupant comfort and productivity and, enhance the operational efficiency of building energy generation and supply systems. This paper presents the BuildCOM project which is driven by the industry and customer needs. It responds to the increasing demands for energy efficiency, comfort, and safety in the buildings sector. The project brings together academic researchers, industrial companies and public partners, to develop and demonstrate an innovative first-of-its-kind software for BMS automated auditing and continuous building commissioning. The software has three major capabilities, initial BMS auditing, BMS retro-commissioning and continuous building commissioning. Thus, the proposed software will aid the design, development and operation of next generation building management systems. The project builds up partly on the online building energy performance monitoring and evaluation (ObepME) tool developed in COORDICY which will be combined with a holistic process for building management systems auditing and commissioning within the developed software solution. The set of tools developed under BuildCOM will be implemented and demonstrated considering multiple case studies. Implementing the proposed solution, the customers and building owners will have up to 35\% higher energy efficiency in newly built and exiting buildings, around 25\% lower operation costs and less emissions from day one and throughout the building operation phase.},

The energy consumption structure is composed of the biomass energy and commercial energy, supplemented by two kinds of mutual use of the way. And Low efficient energy usage and poor indoor environment are major problems in this area. Therefore, the reason for the excessive energy consumption is poor thermal performance of construction, lack of planning standards and low energy efficiency.

  abstract = {In this study, the multi-objective optimization of passive design strategy was conducted for multi-story residential buildings in South Korea. The performance of passive design was analyzed in terms of energy, environmental, and economic metrics, considering the life cycle performance. Various passive design factors were considered to better reflect the actual phenomenon, and a novel simulation modeling method which includes building model simplification and meta model was developed for an accurate and fast calculation of optimization. The sensitivity analysis was conducted to decide critical design factors in optimization and showed that the most influential design factors are airtightness, occupants, and window-to-wall ratio. Throughout optimization, the energy, environmental impact, and economic feasibility in multi-story residential building can be improved by 52.7\%, 39.5\%, and 36.9\%, respectively. The uncertainty of optimal solution was analyzed though the uncertainty analysis. If the utility cost increases and energy system efficiency improves in the future, the optimal passive design solution will not change significantly in energy and economic feasibility, however it may become more critical in the environmental impact.},

  abstract = {In any construction project, cost effectiveness plays a crucial role. The Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis provides a method of determining entire cost of a structure over its expected life along with operational and maintenance cost. LCC can be improved by adopting alternative modern techniques without much alteration in the building. LCC effectiveness can be calculated at various stages of entire span of the building. Moreover this provides decision makers with the financial information necessary for maintaining, improving, and constructing facilities. Financial benefits associated with energy use can also be calculated using LCC analysis. In the present work, case study of two educational buildings has been considered. The LCC of these buildings has been calculated with existing condition and with proposed energy efficient approach (EEA) using net present value method. A solar panel having minimum capacity as well as solar panel with desired capacity as per the requirements of the building has been suggested. The comparison of LCC of existing structure with proposed solar panel system shows that 4\% of cost can be reduced in case of minimum capacity solar panel and 54\% cost can be reduced for desired capacity solar panel system, along with other added advantages of solar energy.},

Currently, manufacturers mainly employ proprietary formats, such as BIM objects supplemented by PDF docu\- ments to represent their product data descriptions. However, these formats do not support flexible automated product search and data integration. This paper describes the use of Semantic Web technologies in combination with BIM-based visual programming language (VPL) to automatically integrate product data from external da\- tabases. To facilitate data integration, we introduced a method to semantically represent product data linked with the CEN/TS 17623:2021 standard using ontologies in web ontology language (OWL). The study has focused on the use case of a manufacturer of lighting products. Results show that building designers are able to execute a more efficient product search that satisfies their query requirements and returns suitable products of their choice from the manufacturer's database based on their requests. This approach eliminates the time-consuming and error-prone process of manually entering product data into BIM software.},

  abstract = {Due to global warming and climate changes, buildings including residential and commercial are significant contributors to energy consumption. To this end, net zero energy building (NZEB) has become a progressively popular concept where the annual sum of power generation and consumption is zero. However, occasionally, there exists a mismatching between demand and supply in NZEB due to consumer behaviour and weather conditions disturbing the overall management of the smart grid. To overcome such hurdles, precise prediction of energy usage is a key strategy among others. Therefore, in this study, an efficient hybrid AI-based framework is proposed for accurate forecasting of power consumption and generation that is mainly composed of three steps. Initially, the optimal pre-processing procedure is applied for data refinement. Next, for the spatiotemporal features, a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) is used that learns discriminative patterns from the past power knowledge, followed by a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BDGRU) that extracts on temporal aspects. Eventually, feature descriptors are then passed to multilayer perceptron layers to perform the forecasting. After extensive experiments over the household and photovoltaic energy data, we concluded that our model substantially reduced the errors of 0.012 and 0.045 in terms of mean square error (MSE) on hourly data as compared to the recent state-of-the-art techniques (SOTA).},

  abstract = {Due to global warming and climate changes, buildings including residential and commercial are significant contributors to energy consumption. To this end, net zero energy building (NZEB) has become a progressively popular concept where the annual sum of power generation and consumption is zero. However, occasionally, there exists a mismatching between demand and supply in NZEB due to consumer behaviour and weather conditions disturbing the overall management of the smart grid. To overcome such hurdles, precise prediction of energy usage is a key strategy among others. Therefore, in this study, an efficient hybrid AI-based framework is proposed for accurate forecasting of power consumption and generation that is mainly composed of three steps. Initially, the optimal pre-processing procedure is applied for data refinement. Next, for the spatiotemporal features, a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) is used that learns discriminative patterns from the past power knowledge, followed by a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BDGRU) that extracts on temporal aspects. Eventually, feature descriptors are then passed to multilayer perceptron layers to perform the forecasting. After extensive experiments over the household and photovoltaic energy data, we concluded that our model substantially reduced the errors of 0.012 and 0.045 in terms of mean square error (MSE) on hourly data as compared to the recent state-of-the-art techniques (SOTA).},

  abstract = {Building envelope parameters and geometric configurations can considerably influence the building energy performance. However, determining the best trade-offs of different building shape and envelope configurations to yield near-optimal design alternatives with respect to their energy performance is not a straight-forward task. Consequently, different methods have been utilized to optimize building envelope parameters and geometric configurations to achieve better energy performance. The objective of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the optimization methods and their application in energy-efficient architectural building design to better identify the potentials and applicability of different optimization methods. This paper reviews the optimization research, where building envelope parameters and geometric configurations are considered remarkably as the optimization independent variable(s) and building energy consumption/demand is included as an objective in the optimization process. The associated derivative-free and derivative-based optimization methods and their application in energy-efficient building design are included in this review. In addition, decision-making approaches are discussed for multi-objective optimizations. Current optimization tools are demonstrated. Finally, crucial considerations, including limitations and suggestions for the related future studies are concluded.},

Shading devices can in fact largely influence solar gains in a building and improve thermal and lighting comforts by selectively intercepting the solar radiation and by reducing the undesirable glare. A proper shading device can therefore significantly increase the thermal performance of a building by reducing its energy demand in different climate conditions. In order to identify the set of optimal shading devices that allow a low energy consumption of the dwelling while maintaining high levels of thermal and lighting comfort for the inhabitants we derive a multi-objective optimization methodology based on Harmony Search and Pareto front approaches. The results show that the multi-objective approach here proposed is an effective procedure in designing energy efficient shading devices when a large set of conflicting objectives characterizes the performance of the proposed solutions.

However, securing consistent occupant feedback for model development is challenging as the current methods of data collection rely on individuals' survey participation. We explored the use of a new type of feedback, occupants' heating and cooling behavior with a personal comfort system (PCS) for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals' thermal preference. The model development draws from field data including PCS control behavior, environmental conditions and mechanical system settings collected from 38 occupants in an office building, and employs six machine learning algorithms. The results showed that (1) personal comfort models based on all field data produced the median accuracy of 0.73 among all subjects and improved predictive accuracy compared to conventional models (PMV, adaptive) which produced a median accuracy of 0.51; (2) the PMV and adaptive models produced individual comfort predictions only slightly better than random guessing under the relatively mild indoor environment observed in the field study; and (3) the models based on PCS control behavior produced the best prediction accuracy when individually assessing all categories of field data acquired in the study. We conclude that personal comfort models based on occupants' heating and cooling behavior can effectively predict individuals' thermal preference and can therefore be used in everyday comfort management to improve occupant satisfaction and energy use in buildings.},

  abstract = {This study compares building electric energy prediction approaches that use a traditional statistical method (linear regression) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. We investigate how significantly occupancy rates and local environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity ratio, solar radiation, cloud type, and wind speed, impact the actual electric energy consumption of a campus building for both working and non-working days. To analyze the degree of impact of each input data type element, an impact value factor was applied to these data sets. The results illustrate that the ANN modeling was more accurate and stable than the linear regression method in predicting the electricity consumption for working days. By impact factor analysis for working days, occupancy rates were found to strongly dominate the electricity consumption in the building, while temperature and humidity also affected the results. However, there were no accuracy differences between the two models in predicting electricity consumption on non-working days because different data type elements had similar impact on the non-working day results. The two models---linear regression and ANN with a Levenberg--Marquardt Back Propagation (LM-BP) algorithm---were able to meet the long-term and real-time hourly prediction requirements for electricity consumption of an actual building based on occupancy rates and local environmental conditions. The analysis of the input element changes on a macroscopic scale is helpful in predicting how each element influences electric energy consumption in buildings with numerical impact factor. The proposed ANN method with LM-BP algorithm can be used as a reliable approach, compared with the linear regression modeling, for predicting the electricity consumption of a building.},

  abstract = {Thermal energy storage (TES) for a cooling plant is a crucial resource for load flexibility. Traditionally, simple, heuristic control approaches, such as the storage priority control which charges TES during the nighttime and discharges during the daytime, have been widely used in practice, and shown reasonable performance in the past benefiting both the grid and the end-users such as buildings and district energy systems. However, the increasing penetration of renewables changes the situation, exposing the grid to a growing duck curve, which encourages the consumption of more energy in the daytime, and volatile renewable generation which requires dynamic planning. The growing pressure of diminishing greenhouse gas emissions also increases the complexity of cooling TES plant operations as different control strategies may apply to optimize operations for energy cost or carbon emissions. This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC), site demonstration and evaluation results of optimal operation of a chiller plant, TES and behind-meter photovoltaics for a campus-level district cooling system. The MPC was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program for better numerical and control properties. Compared with baseline rule-based controls, the MPC results show reductions of the excess PV power by around 25\%, of the greenhouse gas emission by 10\%, and of peak electricity demand by 10\%.},

We report on a largescale experiment--over half a million runs of C4.5 and a Naive-Bayes algorithm--to estimate the effects of different parameters on these algrithms on real-world datasets. For crossvalidation we vary the number of folds and whether the folds are stratified or not, for bootstrap, we vary the number of bootstrap samples. Our results indicate that for real-word datasets similar to ours, The best method to use for model selection is ten fold stratified cross validation even if computation power allows using more folds.},

Yet, the lack of compatibility between existing metadata normalization methods precludes the possibility of comparing and combining them. While generic machine learning (ML) frameworks, such as MLJAR and OpenML, provide versatile interfaces for standard ML problems, they cannot easily accommodate the metadata normalization tasks for buildings due to the heterogeneity in the inference scope, type of data required as input, evaluation metric, and the building-specific human-in-the-loop learning procedure. We propose Plaster, an open and modular framework that incorporates existing advances in building metadata normalization. It provides unified programming interfaces for various types of learning methods for metadata normalization and defines standardized data models for building metadata and timeseries data. Thus, it enables the integration of different methods via a workflow, benchmarking of different methods via unified interfaces, and rapid prototyping of new algorithms. With Plaster, we 1) show three examples of the workflow integration, delivering better performance than individual algorithms, 2) benchmark/analyze five algorithms over five common buildings, and 3) exemplify the process of developing a new algorithm involving time series features. We believe Plaster will facilitate the development of new algorithms and expedite the adoption of standard metadata schema such as Brick, in order to enable seamless smart building applications in the future.},

The paper begins by discussing the carbon impact of the sector and the concept of `smart campuses' applied to the sector in the context of decarbonisation. Opportunities and challenges associated with integrating smart energy systems at the university campus from a policy and technical perspective are then discussed. This is followed by a review of building and campus-scale frameworks supporting a transition to smart energy campuses using the BPIE' Smart Buildings' framework. The paper finds that the complexity of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for new and existing higher education buildings and energy systems can be addressed with the adoption of `smart building principles' and integrating 'smartness' into their energy systems. Several universities in the UK and worldwide are integrating smart services and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in their operations following the smart campus premise. At the building level, existing frameworks often create conceptual roadmaps for the smart building premise or propose technical implementation and assessment methods. At university campus scale, implementation typically comes through single-vector interventions, and only few examples exist that propose a multi-vector approach. Comparisons of the drivers and the decision-making process are made, with carbon and cost reduction being the most prominent from leveraging distributed energy generation. Therefore, this study identified the need for a comprehensive technical or policy framework to drive the uptake of the smart energy campus, aiming to bring together the holistic value of smart energy campuses.},

  abstract = {Energy metering has gained popularity as conventional meters are replaced by electronic smart meters that promise energy savings and higher comfort levels for occupants. Achieving these goals requires a deeper understanding of consumption patterns to reduce the energy footprint: load profile forecasting, power disaggregation, appliance identification, startup event detection, etc. Publicly available datasets are used to test, verify, and benchmark possible solutions to these problems. For this purpose, we present the BLOND dataset: continuous energy measurements of a typical office environment at high sampling rates with common appliances and load profiles. We provide voltage and current readings for aggregated circuits and matching fully-labeled ground truth data (individual appliance measurements). The dataset contains 53 appliances (16 classes) in a 3-phase power grid. BLOND-50 contains 213 days of measurements sampled at 50kSps (aggregate) and 6.4kSps (individual appliances). BLOND-250 consists of the same setup: 50 days, 250kSps (aggregate), 50kSps (individual appliances). These are the longest continuous measurements at such high sampling rates and fully-labeled ground truth we are aware of.},

As a potential solution to the interoperability issues, there has been increasing interest in how linked data and semantic web technologies can be used to establish an extendable data model. Semantic web ontologies have been developed for the AEC domain, but an ontology for describing the energy and mass flow between systems and components is missing. This study proposes the Flow Systems Ontology (FSO) for describing the composition of flow systems, and their mass and energy flows. Two example models are expressed using FSO vocabulary. SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries are performed to further demonstrate and validate the ontology. The main contribution consists of developing FSO as an ontology complementary to the existing ontologies. Finally, the paper introduces a roadmap for future developments building on FSO.},

  abstract = {Structured information about the available components in each building is critical to build scalable and maintainable smart building applications. Recent work has proposed a solid knowledge base for what information is needed and how to represent the information as metadata models. However, populating metadata models with information is still an extensive process. Therefore, it is important to consider how other digital sources of information about a building can aid this process. Building information models, such as IFC, are used as a common digital representation throughout the design and construction of buildings. Therefore, IFC models hold the potential to provide many of the elements needed by a metadata model for a building. In this paper, we document to which extend this premise holds by quantifying the IFC model elements that can be used to populate a Brick metadata model, both according to the specification and the actual IFC models implementing that specification. Our results show that considering the specification 4.5\% of the elements in an IFC model can map to an element of the Brick metadata model. However, when considering the data in actual IFC models of 20 buildings our results show that only 0.2\% of the content can be mapped to Brick. We interview building industry professionals to put a context to those numbers.},

Electric load profile characterization can generate useful information to enhance building energy modeling and provide metrics to represent patterns and variability of load profiles. Such characterizations can be used to identify changes to building electricity demand due to operations or faulty equipment and controls. In this study, we proposed a two-path approach to analyze high temporal resolution building electrical load profiles: (1) time-domain analysis and (2) frequency-domain analysis. The commonly adopted time-domain analysis can extract and quantify the distribution of key parameters characterizing load shape such as peak-base load ratio and morning rise time, while a frequency-domain analysis can identify major periodic fluctuations and quantify load variability. We implemented and evaluated both paths using whole-year 15-minute interval smart meter data of 188 commercial office building in Northern California. The results from these two paths are consistent with each other and complementary to represent full dynamics of load profiles. The time- and frequency-domain analyses can be used to enhance building energy modeling by: (1) providing more realistic assumptions about building operation schedules, and (2) validating the simulated electric load profiles using the developed variability metrics against the real building load data.},

The conventionally used local sensitivity methods are based on linear hypothesis and have limitations in the application process of nonlinear systems, while the more complicated global sensitivity methods may have problem in time costs. To compare and propose the proper method for evaluation of thermal-hydraulic calculation in a reactor system, local methods such as Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and Kendall rank correlation coefficient, global methods such as the variance-based method, moment-independent method, and elementary effects method are reviewed and applied for numerical examples and specific reactor thermal-hydraulic problem in this paper. Results show that the rank of parameter importance measured by various local analysis methods is the same, but away from the global methods. Different types of global sensitivity analysis methods have similar results for parameters with higher importance, and among these methods, the elementary effects method has the lowest computational cost with the same number of samples.},

  abstract = {Recent advanced architectural algorithms, such as real-time optimization control and fault diagnostics, have garnered significant interest for their ability to reduce building energy consumption and improve equipment maintenance efficiency. However, deploying these algorithms in actual buildings often involves significant manual effort and time to align building data points with algorithmic requirements. In response, standardized ontologies like the Brick Schema have been introduced. This ontology streamlines the representation of building topology, equipment, and data points, as well as algorithm inputs, enabling quicker algorithm integration and deployment. Despite these advancements, manually constructing Brick models from scratch remains time-consuming, laborious, and prone to errors, presenting a new challenge in rapid model development. To overcome these issues, some researchers have turned to universal BIM formats, such as IFC/Revit, for accelerated Brick modeling. Nevertheless, the prevalence of errors in human-generated BIM models often impedes effective conversion. To efficiently convert imperfect IFC models into Brick models, this paper presents a novel BIM to Brick methodology comprising three key steps: IFC inspection and repair, IFC to Brick semantic modeling, and dataset mapping. This method ensures high-quality reuse of even imperfect IFC models. Our case study demonstrates that this method can produce an ideal Brick model from a flawed BIM model, meeting the semantic metadata requirements specified by the BuildingMOTIF tool. This innovative approach substantially reduces the effort required to generate Brick models, effectively handling the inaccuracies and noise inherent in real-world BIM.},

  abstract = {As a new system, variable refrigerant flow system with water-cooled condenser (water-cooled VRF) can offer several interesting characteristics for potential users. However, at present, its dynamic simulation simultaneously in association with building and other equipments is not yet included in the energy simulation programs. Based on the EnergyPlus's codes, and using manufacturer's performance parameters and data, the special simulation module for water-cooled VRF is developed and embedded in the software of EnergyPlus. After modeling and testing the new module, on the basis of a typical office building in Shanghai with water-cooled VRF system, the monthly and seasonal cooling energy consumption and the breakdown of the total power consumption are analyzed. The simulation results show that, during the whole cooling period, the fan-coil plus fresh air (FPFA) system consumes about 20\% more power than the water-cooled VRF system does. The power comparison between the water-cooled VRF system and the air-cooled VRF system is performed too. All of these can provide designers some ideas to analyze the energy features of this new system and then to determine a better scheme of the air conditioning system.},

  abstract = {Building Performance Optimization (BPO) plays a pivotal role in enhancing building performance, guaranteeing comfort while reducing resource consumption. Existing performance-driven generative design is computational demanding and difficult to be generalized to other similar buildings with difficult to be generalized to other building types or climate conditions. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a novel framework, which integrates multitask learning (MTL), code compliance check, and multi-objective optimization through NSGA-III algorithm. This framework is able to identify Paratoo Optimal design solutions, which comply with building codes, at low computation costs. The framework begins with selecting key design variables that are critical to building energy, comfort performance and life cycle cost. It then employs MTL to enhance the model's accuracy while reducing computational costs. Next, we designed a code compliance checking module followed by the NSGA-III optimization process, with the objective of identifying solutions that comply with existing building codes. The results indicate that the proposed MTL network achieved an R2 score of 0.983--0.993 on the test set. In the particular case study where equal weights are preferred, this approach yielded noteworthy reductions of 27.65\%, 19.55\%, and 31.13\% in Building Energy Consumption (BEC), Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and Residue of continuous Daylight Autonomy (RcDA), respectively, for a rural dwelling, and exclude solutions that fail to satisfy regulatory standards. This framework allows designer to input the weights of each objective based on their preference and can be applied to other building types and climate regions. Last, we develop a solution selection tool based on the results output by the framework we proposed, which can be found at https://github.com/LiMingchen159/Village-House-Design-Strategy-in-Hebei-Province-China.},

Traditional building performance indicators mostly focus on the energy efficiency perspective. As occupants are the primary building service recipients in residential and most commercial buildings, their comfort and wellbeing are crucial. This study first identified significant attributes of occupant-centric key performance indicators (KPIs) and analyzed the diverse factors that should be considered in formulating an occupant-centric KPI. Then a suite of occupant-centric KPIs were synthesized from the review and enhancement of existing occupant-related performance metrics. The proposed occupant KPIs represent the occupant lens on three integrative aspects of building performance: resource use (including energy and water), indoor environmental quality, and human--building interactions. A simulation-based case study was conducted to demonstrate how occupant-centric KPIs can be used to quantify the impacts of building operation changes from the occupants' point of view.Highlights Occupant-centric metrics are currently ad hoc and limited, yet crucial to inform building design and operations.Literature was reviewed to reveal the state-of-the-art and gaps of occupant-centric metrics.A suite of occupant-centric key performance indicators (KPIs) covering five groups of building services were synthesized.Proposed occupant KPIs represent three aspects of performance: resource use and demand, occupant comfort and health, and human--building interactions.A case study using whole building simulation was conducted to demonstrate the use of occupant-centric KPIs in evaluating building operations during a power outage.},

  abstract = {Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window. Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature. Our goal is to provide a self-contained explication of the state of the art together with a historical perspective and references to primary research.},

  abstract = {Building metadata is regarded as the signpost in organizing massive building data. The application of building metadata simplifies the creation of digital representations and provides portable data analytics. Typical metadata standards such as Brick and Haystack are used to describe the data of the building system. Brick uses standard ontologies to create building metadata. However, neither Haystack nor Brick has provided definitions about the Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) system so far. For years, both Brick and Haystack working groups have been discussing how to describe VRF in their schema, mainly about the classification of VRF and the definitions of VRF units. There were no settled solutions for these problems. Meanwhile, the global VRF market is growing increasingly fast because of the energy efficiency and installation simplicity of the VRF system. It is needed to have the metadata to describe VRF units in buildings for data analysis and management. Addressing this challenge, this paper extended Brick Schema with the VRF module and verified the Brick VRF module. Then, the model and the service framework were developed and applied for a building in China. The framework can serve portable energy analysis for different areas. The VRF module of this paper provides a possible solution for the expression of the VRF system in the building semantic web. The works in this paper will support semantic web in automation strategies for building management and scalable building operation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a semantic model-based approach is proposed for building energy systems fault detection. Its basic idea is to mimic the general intelligence of human experts in understanding massive amounts of operational data of various buildings, and further proposing customized fault detection solutions. A domain ontology is developed to allow computers to understand the prior knowledge of building energy systems fault detection. Classes and properties are developed to formalize all possible configurations in this domain. Semantic rules are proposed to detect the operation problems, control problems, equipment malfunction and sensor failure in building energy systems. These rules are written in abstract syntax. They can be reused in various building energy systems. For a target system, the building data are mapped to the ontology to generate a customized knowledge graph. The knowledge graph captures the physics underlying the system operations. The semantic rules are activated based on the knowledge graph to detect the faults. The proposed approach is demonstrated using the historical data from an industrial building located in Wuhan, China. The results show that the approach is powerful in providing the customized fault detection solutions for different situations. It has high levels of interpretability, reliability and automation. The knowledge graph is automatically updated with new data step by step. The semantic rules are activated if the conditions are satisfied based on the knowledge graph. The fault action mechanisms are captured based on the inference chains of the rules. Experts can find the fault reasons and take actions for commissioning.},

  abstract = {Energy flexibility of buildings can be an essential resource for a sustainable and reliable power grid with the growing variable renewable energy shares and the trend to electrify and decarbonize buildings. Traditional demand-side management technologies, advanced building controls, and emerging distributed energy resources (including electric vehicle, energy storage, and on-site power generation) enable the transition of the building stock to grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that operate efficiently to meet service needs and are responsive to grid pricing or carbon signals to achieve energy and carbon neutrality. Although energy flexibility has received growing attention from industry and the research community, there remains a lack of common ground for energy flexibility terminologies, characterization, and quantification methods. This paper presents a semantic ontology---EFOnt (Energy Flexibility Ontology)---that extends existing terminologies, ontologies, and schemas for building energy flexibility applications. EFOnt aims to serve as a standardized tool for knowledge co-development and streamlining energy flexibility related applications. We demonstrate potential use cases of EFOnt via two examples: (1) energy flexibility analytics with measured data from a residential smart thermostat dataset and a commercial building, and (2) modeling and simulation to evaluate energy flexibility of buildings. The compatibility of EFOnt with existing ontologies and the outlook of EFOnt's role in the building energy data tool ecosystem are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents a new technology which supports the creation and management of a construction project for buildings. The most well-known open BIM standard, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), provides the detailed 3D geometry and rich spatial semantics. It has drawn growing attention of researchers working in geographical information science (GIS). In many related applications, indoor navigation greatly benefits from IFC since it requires the information about building interiors. IFC provides the semantics and geometry of building, and topological relationships of building elements can be readily derived. These three types of information are extensively used in the research on indoor navigation. In this paper we review the current approaches, applications and solutions developed for different aspects of indoor navigation, and summarize the latest status about the use of IFC-based BIM for indoor navigation. In the literature regarding both IFC and indoor navigation, a total of 87 related papers are identified and categorized. 30 papers relate to the generation of indoor navigation models; 20 papers are about model conversion and data modeling on the basis of the IFC schema; 13 papers refer to IFC applications with dynamic environments; 14 papers focus on the support of IFC to indoor localization; and the other papers involve various topics such as visualization and network queries based on IFC. We find that the most active research direction is to generate navigation models from IFC data, yet there is no robust automation method of the generation. By discussing the pros and cons of the current applications, this paper suggests three new directions for further research on the IFC supports to indoor navigation. That is, researchers can further investigate the vertical dimension of the 3D geometry in IFC, facilitate the transformation from IFC to standardized indoor navigation models and manage real-time data with IFC to reflect indoor changes.},

However, our experiment results show that the existing advanced metric learning technique cannot provide an appropriate distance metric for multi-output tasks. This paper systematically studies how to efficiently learn an appropriate distance metric for multi-output problems with provable guarantee. In particular, we present a novel large margin metric learning paradigm for multi-output tasks, which projects both the input and output into the same embedding space and then learns a distance metric to discover output dependency such that instances with very different multiple outputs will be moved far away. Several strategies are then proposed to speed up the training and testing time. Moreover, we study the generalization error bound of our method for three learning tasks, which shows that our method converges to the optimal solutions. Experiments on three multi-output learning tasks (multi-label classification, multi-target regression, and multi-concept retrieval) validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {A vertical thermally stratified environment provides opportunities for improved ventilation effectiveness and energy efficiency, but vertical temperature gradient can also cause local thermal discomfort. ASHRAE 55 and ISO 7730 prescribe a 3~{$^\circ$}C/m limit between head and feet for seated persons. However, an increasing amount of evidence suggests that this limit is too restrictive. To revisit how vertical temperature gradient affects local thermal comfort, we conducted laboratory tests with four nominal vertical temperature gradients (0.4, 2.9, 5.9, and 8.4~{$^\circ$}C/m). Ninety-eight seated college-age students participated in a blind within-subject experiment. Cold-feet discomfort is more frequently rated than warm-head discomfort with increasing temperature gradients. By using logistic regression modeling, we show that the whole-body dissatisfaction increases only slightly ({$<$}10\%) with vertical temperature gradient, even up to 8.4~{$^\circ$}C/m. Sex does not significantly affect the results except at 8.4~{$^\circ$}C/m. Acceptable vertical temperature gradient changes with thermal sensation votes. The results suggest that the vertical temperature gradient could be increased to 5~{$^\circ$}C/m between head and feet when the subject is thermally neutral.},

The development of such innovative materials and technologies, as well as their real-world implementation, can be enhanced with the use of building performance simulation (BPS). Performance prediction of adaptive facades can, however, be a challenging task and the information on this topic is scarce and fragmented. The main contribution of this review article is to bring together and analyse the existing information in this field. In the first part, the unique requirements for successful modelling and simulation of adaptive facades are discussed. In the second part, the capabilities of five widely used BPS tools are reviewed, in terms of their ability to model energy and occupant comfort performance of adaptive facades. Finally, it discusses various ongoing trends and research needs in this field.},

  abstract = {Overheight vehicle collisions continuously pose a serious threat to transportation infrastructure and public safety. This study proposed a vision-based method for automatic vehicle height measurement using deep learning and view geometry. In this method, vehicle instances are first segmented from traffic surveillance video frames by exploiting mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN). Then, 3D bounding box on each vehicle instance is constructed using the obtained vehicle silhouette and three orthogonal vanishing points in the surveilled traffic scene. By doing so, the vertical edges of the constructed 3D bounding box are directly associated with the vehicle image height. Last, the vehicle's physical height is computed by referencing an object with a known height in the traffic scene using single view metrology. A field experiment was performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, leading to the mean and maximum errors of 3.6 and 6.6, 5.8 and 12.9, 4.4 and 8.1, and 9.2 and 18.5 cm for cars, buses, vans, and trucks, respectively. The experiment also demonstrated the ability of the method to overcome vehicle occlusion, shadow, and irregular appearance interferences in height estimation suffered by existing image-based methods. The results signified the potential of the proposed method for overheight vehicle detection and collision warning in real traffic settings.},

  abstract = {Energy-related behaviors of occupants constitute a key factor influencing building performance; accordingly, the measured occupant data can support the objective assessment of the indoor environment and energy performance of buildings, which can inform building design and operational decisions. Existing data schemas focus on metadata of sensors, meters, physical equipment, and IoT devices in buildings; however, they are limited in representing the metadata of occupant data, including occupants' presence in spaces, movement between spaces, interactions with building systems or IoT devices, and preference of indoor environmental needs. To address this gap, an extension to the widely adopted metadata schema, Brick, is proposed to represent the contextual, behavioral, and demographic information of occupants. The proposed extension includes four parts: (1) a new "Occupant" class to represent occupants' demography and energy related behavioral patterns, (2) new subclasses under the Equipment class to represent envelope system and personal thermal comfort devices, (3) new subclasses under the Point class to represent occupant sensing and status, and (4) new auxiliary properties for occupant interactable equipment to represent the level of controllability for each piece of equipment by occupants. The extension is implemented in the Brick schema and has been tested using multiple occupant datasets from the ASHRAE Global Occupant Database. The extension enables Brick schema to capture diverse types of occupant sensing data and their metadata for FAIR data research and applications.},

However, BIM's use in the building operation phase is limited. With the increasing deployment of low-cost sensors and meters, as well as affordable digital storage and computing technologies, growing volumes of data have been collected from buildings, their energy services systems, and occupants. Such data are crucial to help decision makers understand what, how, and when energy is consumed in buildings---a critical step to improving building performance for energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience. However, practical analyses and use of the collected data are very limited due to various reasons, including poor data quality, ad-hoc representation of data, and lack of data science skills.

The selected data tools are grouped into three categories: (1) data dictionary or terminology, (2) data ontology and schemas, and (3) data platforms. The data are grouped into ten typologies covering most types of data collected in buildings. This study resulted in five main findings: (1) most data representation tools can represent their intended data typologies well, such as Green Button for smart meter data and Brick schema for metadata of sensors in buildings and HVAC systems, but none of the tools cover all ten types of data; (2) there is a need for data schemas to represent the basis of design data and metadata of occupant data; (3) standard terminologies such as those defined in BEDES are only adopted in a few data tools; (4) integrating data across various stages in the building life cycle remains a challenge; and (5) most data tools were developed and maintained by different parties for different purposes, their flexibility and interoperability can be improved to support broader use cases.

The GAINN approach presented in this study first uses a simulation-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to characterize building behaviour, and then combines this ANN with a multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for optimization. The methodology has been used in the current study for the optimization of thermal comfort and energy consumption in a residential house. Results of ANN training and validation are first discussed. Two optimizations were then conducted taking variables from HVAC system settings, thermostat programming, and passive solar design. By integrating ANN into optimization the total simulation time was considerably reduced compared to classical optimization methodology. Results of the optimizations showed significant reduction in terms of energy consumption as well as improvement in thermal comfort. Finally, thanks to the multiobjective approach, dozens of potential designs were revealed, with a wide range of trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy consumption.},

In the vast majority of cases, real-world datasets lead to more accurate models and algorithms. AMPds2 is the first dataset to capture all three main types of consumption (electricity, water, and natural gas) over a long period of time (2 years) and provide 11 measurement characteristics for electricity. No other such datasets from Canada exist. Each meter has 730 days of captured data. We also include environmental and utility billing data for cost analysis. AMPds2 data has been pre-cleaned to provide for consistent and comparable accuracy results amongst different researchers and machine learning algorithms.},

In this paper, two local traditional stilted houses, old-fashioned and new-fashioned, were selected for case study to investigate indoor environmental quality by field survey. The indoor thermal, luminous and acoustic environment and CO2 concentrations were tested and evaluated. Results indicated that the electric heating cannot meet the comfort requirements due to the bad thermal performance of the wooden envelope, while heating by the coal stove would cause indoor air pollution. The sound resistance effect of the wooden fabric is so poor that indoor human activities can bring the noise interference to the adjacent room. In addition, the indoor natural lighting illumination was much lower than the standard requirements due to improper interior space layout design, such as few windows with small open area. It is necessary to improve indoor environment for this traditional house for sustainable development. In this study, the indoor environmental conditions in the local traditional houses was objectively evaluated, which helps to guide the residence retrofit and improve indoor environment in the future.},

  abstract = {In a recent publication, we presented anew multiobjective decision-making tool for use in conceptual engineering design. In the present paper, we provide important developments that support the next phase in the evolution of the tool. These developments, together with those of our previous work, provide a concept selection approach that capitalizes on the benefits of computational optimization. Specifically, the new approach uses the efficiency and effectiveness of optimization to rapidly compare numerous designs, and characterize the tradeoff properties within the multiobjective design space. As such, the new approach differs significantly from traditional (non-optimization based) concept selection approaches where, comparatively speaking, significant time is often spent evaluating only a few points in the design space. Under the new approach, design concepts are evaluated using a so-called s-Pareto frontier; this frontier originates from the Pareto frontiers of various concepts, and is the Pareto frontier for the set of design concepts. An important characteristic of the s-Pareto frontier is that it provides a foundation for analyzing tradeoffs between design objectives and the tradeoffs between design concepts. The new developments presented in this paper include; (i) the notion of minimally representing the s-Pareto frontier, (ii) the quantification of concept goodness using s-Pareto frontiers, (iii) the development of an interactive design space exploration approach that can be used to visualize n-dimensional s-Pareto frontiers, and (iv) s-Pareto frontier-based approaches for considering uncertainty in concept selection. Simple structural examples are presented that illustrate representative applications of the proposed method.},

Despite the critical need for community-based city management, current decision-making approaches are often uninformed by the collective behavior of communities across time and in different locations. Here, we introduce a computer vision-based monitoring and forecasting approach for Smart City Digital Twins (SCDT) that enables integrating collective behavior into the spatiotemporal assessments of exposure to urban heat stress. Our results from a pilot case study in the city of Columbus, GA, demonstrate the significance of integrating community dynamics into monitoring and forecasting urban hazard exposure. This ongoing study highlights how SCDT can make community dynamics more accessible to and responsive by city managers.},

Recent efforts in semantic data modelling aim to over come these barriers, though application development re mains building-specific, leading to bespoke configurations that cannot scale. This research seeks to establish a new regime of data-driven applications that are developed once and run across multiple buildings --- similarly to the appli cations we download and use in our mobile phones. This research contributes to realising this vision in two ways: introducing (a) a method for automatic building metadata model generation through the lifecycle, and (b) a portable application development paradigm that offsets the burden of configuration in the authoring process. An overview of this vision and contributions are illustrated in Figure 1. These advancements are expected to overcome expertise barriers, reduce time for applications' configuration and deployment, and thus, accelerate their adoption at scale.},

Due to their high energy consumption and material use, tall buildings have drawn particular attention with respect to their environmental impact. The influence of structural systems on the environmental performance of tall buildings is studied in this work, through calculating the embodied energy and CO2 emissions of construction materials. In this direction, characteristic structural systems of tall buildings are considered in order to compare their environmental behaviour and account for their differences on the amount of construction materials used for their formation. In order to achieve this comparison, the structural systems are material-cost optimized using an optimization computing platform (OCP) developed by the authors for solving real-world structural design optimization problems. The results of this research provide valuable findings for the significant role of structural optimization in sustainable design of tall buildings as well as in limiting the use of construction materials.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the HVAC system topology is required in several design and operation activities, including setting up building energy simulation models, fault detection and control applications, and facility management tasks. In theory, we can use the geometric context captured in Building Information Models (BIM) to infer these topological relationships; in practice, these models are far from perfect, with modelling errors and omissions. The implication is that manual remodelling is required, which results in unnecessary and redundant work. This paper discusses first the data quality issues faced in real-world data transformation workflows. We propose a methodology for generating good-quality HVAC topological models from imperfect BIM models. Our method's core is a rule-based model-checking framework to identify missing elements. Once an issue is detected, a geometric-relationship enrichment tool is invoked to infer missing topological information. The proposed approach is tested in a real-world complex BIM model, and we discuss lessons learnt.},

  abstract = {In buildings of residential and tertiary sectors, daylight issues primarily respond to increasing needs regarding the occupants' well being and visual confort as well as to the supply of natural light for working, by decreasing energy consumption due to necessary artificial lightning for the internal human activities. Daylight optimization at an early design stage can be referred to a way of designing architectural forms that take advantage of the prevailing urban context, such as existing shadow masks, to achieve a comfortable interior environment while minimizing energy use and reliance on artificial lighting systems. Our past study concluded in the development of EcCoGen, which is a kind of software that belongs to the family of tools based on interactive generative genetic algorithm optimization. The software generates solutions evaluated according to certain criteria, including mainly energy performance issues. Since the energy evaluation is included in the software features, we aimed to enhance software's applicability including energy reduction due to lighting issues via visual comfort optimization. Based on this objective, in this paper we describe a simple methodology to optimize the daylight potential of an architectural form at an early design stage. A numerical approach conducted employing the DIALux 4.5{\copyright} is presented while a variety of simulation scenarios has been investigated on the basis of Doehlert and Box--Behnken DOE (design of experiments) methods. Our purpose is to develop accurate enough regression models for daylight factor prediction at an early design stage, when the problem's data are not precisely determined (dimension of glazing area, materials, opacities). To validate this statistical forecast system, many simulation scenarios were carried out and the statistical results are in compliance with the numerical simulations. The regression models' results show that the error caused by simplification is acceptable in most conditions, and a lot of coupling calculation is saved. Finally, a formal error analysis for the resulted regression models has been conducted to validate its forecast capacity. As a conclusion the statistical reduction of complex numerical modeling to simple regression models in the form of polynomial equations aims to assist architects and engineers to directly obtain a high precision estimation of their architectural form's daylight potential at an early design stage.},

Detailed data on residential electricity use have many interrelated research applications, from energy conservation to non-intrusive load monitoring, energy storage, integration of renewables, and electric vs. fossil-based heating. The dataset presented here, Multifamily Residential Electricity Dataset (MFRED), contains the electricity use of 390 apartments, ranging from studios to four-bedroom units. All apartments are located in the Northeastern United States (IECC-climate-zone 4\,A), but differ in their heating/cooling system and construction year (early to late 20th century). To adhere to privacy guidelines, data were averaged across 15 apartments each, based on annual electricity use. MFRED includes real and reactive power, at 10-second resolution, for January to December 2019 (246 million data points). The annual average real power per apartment is 343\,W (3.27\,W/m2 of floor area), with strong variation between seasons and apartment size. Considering its large number of apartments, high time resolution, real and reactive power, and 12-month duration, MFRED is currently unique for the multifamily-sector.},

  abstract = {The majority of decisions in the building design process are taken in the early design stage. This delicate phase presents the greatest opportunity to obtain high performance buildings, but pertinent performance information is needed for designers to be able to deal with multidisciplinary and contrasting objectives. In the present work, an integrative approach for the early stages of building design is proposed to obtain detailed information on energy efficient envelope configurations. By means of genetic algorithms, a multi-objective search was performed with the aim of minimising the energy need for heating, cooling and lighting of a case study. The investigation was carried out for an open space office building by varying number, position, shape and type of windows and the thickness of the masonry walls. The search was performed through an implementation of the NSGA-II algorithm, which was made capable of exchanging information with the EnergyPlus building energy simulation tool. The analyses were conducted both in absence and in presence of an urban context in the climates of Palermo, Torino, Frankfurt and Oslo. In addition, a preliminary analysis on the Pareto front solutions was performed to investigate the statistical variation of the values assumed by the input variables in all the non-dominated solutions. For the analysed case study, results highlighted a small overall Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) of the building in all locations. Pareto front solutions were characterised by low WWR values especially in east, west and north exposed fa{\c c}ades. The area of the south facing windows was higher compared to the other orientations and characterised by a higher variability.},

  abstract = {The classical approach to non-linear regression in physics is to take a mathematical model describing the functional dependence of the dependent variable from a set of independent variables, and then using non-linear fitting algorithms, extract the parameters used in the modeling. Particularly challenging are real systems, characterized by several additional influencing factors related to specific components, like electronics or optical parts. In such cases, to make the model reproduce the data, empirically determined terms are built in the models to compensate for the difficulty of modeling things that are, by construction, difficult to model. A new approach to solve this issue is to use neural networks, particularly feed-forward architectures with a sufficient number of hidden layers and an appropriate number of output neurons, each responsible for predicting the desired variables. Unfortunately, feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) usually perform less efficiently when applied to multi-dimensional regression problems, that is when they are required to predict simultaneously multiple variables that depend from the input dataset in fundamentally different ways. To address this problem, we propose multi-task learning (MTL) architectures. These are characterized by multiple branches of task-specific layers, which have as input the output of a common set of layers. To demonstrate the power of this approach for multi-dimensional regression, the method is applied to luminescence sensing. Here, the MTL architecture allows predicting multiple parameters, the oxygen concentration and temperature, from a single set of measurements.},

  abstract = {To connect the semantic space between various related ontologies, computer scientists and specialists in the field of Semantic Web have suggested and executed different ontology matching systems. In any case, these strategies have a great space for improvement and continuous research should be done to get better results in terms of precision, recall and F-measure for the purpose of aligning ontologies. This work analysed various string similarity metrics for the task of ontology alignment whose definitions are taken from two libraries that are Alignment API and secondstring library. These metrics are used to align different ontologies provided with Alignment API package and then evaluated the performance of these metrics with regard to precision, recall and F-measure. Further, different ontology alignment systems are studied which used string similarity metrics in combination of structural similarity metrics and linguistic similarity metrics. The role of string similarity metrics is analysed and found that Jaccard in combination with TF/IDF similarity metric works good as well as ngram also works better.},

  abstract = {Energy-related behaviors of occupants constitute a key factor influencing building performance; accordingly, the measured occupant data can support the objective assessment of the indoor environment and energy performance of buildings, which can inform building design and operational decisions. Existing data schemas focus on metadata of sensors, meters, physical equipment, and IoT devices in buildings; however, they are limited in representing the metadata of occupant data, including occupants' presence in spaces, movement between spaces, interactions with building systems or IoT devices, and preference of indoor environmental needs. To address this gap, an extension to the widely adopted metadata schema, Brick, is proposed to represent the contextual, behavioral, and demographic information of occupants. The proposed extension includes four parts: (1) a new ``Occupant'' class to represent occupants' demography and energy related behavioral patterns, (2) new subclasses under the Equipment class to represent envelope system and personal thermal comfort devices, (3) new subclasses under the Point class to represent occupant sensing and status, and (4) new auxiliary properties for occupant interactable equipment to represent the level of controllability for each piece of equipment by occupants. The extension is implemented in the Brick schema and has been tested using multiple occupant datasets from the ASHRAE Global Occupant Database. The extension enables Brick schema to capture diverse types of occupant sensing data and their metadata for FAIR data research and applications. {$\bullet$} An extension to the Brick schema was proposed to represent metadata of occupants. {$\bullet$} A new Occupant class is added to represent occupant demographic, behavior, and contextual information. {$\bullet$} Two new subclasses are added to the Equipment and Point classes to represent occupant sensing and data points. {$\bullet$} Human building/equipment interactions and degree of controls are added. {$\bullet$} The extension enables Brick's use for occupant-centric building operation and controls.},

  abstract = {The optimization of heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system operations and other building parameters intended to minimize annual energy consumption and maximize the thermal comfort is presented in this paper. The combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is applied to optimize the two-chiller system operation in a building. The HVAC system installed in the building integrates radiant cooling system, variable air volume (VAV) chiller system, and dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS). Several parameters including thermostat setting, passive solar design, and chiller operation control are considered as decision variables. Subsequently, the percentage of people dissatisfied (PPD) and annual building energy consumption is chosen as objective functions. Multi-objective optimization is employed to optimize the system with two objective functions. As the result, ANN performed a good correlation between decision variables and the objective function. Moreover, MOGA successfully provides several alternative possible design variables to achieve optimum system in terms of thermal comfort and annual energy consumption. In conclusion, the optimization that considers two objectives shows the best result regarding thermal comfort and energy consumption compared to base case design.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in computer science and stringent requirements of the design of ``greener'' buildings put forwards the research and applications of simulation-based optimization methods in the building sector. This paper provides an overview on this subject, aiming at clarifying recent advances and outlining potential challenges and obstacles in building design optimization. Key discussions are focused on handling discontinuous multi-modal building optimization problems, the performance and selection of optimization algorithms, multi-objective optimization, the application of surrogate models, optimization under uncertainty and the propagation of optimization techniques into real-world design challenges. This paper also gives bibliographic information on the issues of simulation programs, optimization tools, efficiency of optimization methods, and trends in optimization studies. The review indicates that future researches should be oriented towards improving the efficiency of search techniques and approximation methods (surrogate models) for large-scale building optimization problems; and reducing time and effort for such activities. Further effort is also required to quantify the robustness in optimal solutions so as to improve building performance stability.},

The need to extend sensing technology through the use of wireless sensors as well as the lack of description tools for understanding, visualizing, and documenting sensor outputs has encouraged researchers to use powerful tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) systems. BIM has become important because of conducting tools widely used in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to present and manage information on structural systems and situations. Since combining health monitoring and maintenance results with BIM models is a new field of study, and most projects utilize various aspects of it, we have conducted a review of important work related to this subject published from 2010 to November of 2020. After reviewing 278 journal articles, research trends, approaches, methods, gaps, and future agenda related to BIM in monitoring and maintenance were highlighted. This paper, through a bibliometric and content analysis, concludes that besides main improvements, some limitations now exist which affect the modeling and maintenance process. These limitations are related to extending the IFC schema, optimizing sensor data, interoperability among various BIM platforms, optimization of various sensing technologies for fault detection and management of huge amounts of data, besides consideration of environmental effects on monitoring hazards and underground objects. Finally, this paper aims to help to solve the mentioned limitation through a comprehensive review of existing research.},

  abstract = {Buildings consume 40\% of the total primary energy and 30\% of the annual electricity, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Naturally, therefore, building energy efficiency and notions like the nearly zero energy buildings are continuously gaining importance and popularity as means to reduce carbon emissions and the strong dependence on fossil fuels. A step towards this direction is the incorporation of smart grid technologies, mainly through the widespread of automatic meter reading and smart meters. This enables automatic collection of in depth information of the customer's behavior along with the building's performance and, thus, introduces new opportunities for energy saving and efficient management. However, the recorded amassing ream of data requires efficient processing and interpretation, so as to provide for meaningful information. In order to tackle this problem, this paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for the investigation of the electricity behavior of buildings, using clustering techniques. Utilizing a university campus as a case study, the proposed methodology is applied to the load curves of different buildings leading to the determination of an optimum clustering procedure. The methodology may be generalized for any type of building.},

  abstract = {Due to population growth, climate change, and the urban heat island effect, heat exposure is becoming an important issue facing urban built environments. Heat exposure assessment is a prerequisite for mitigation measures to reduce the impact of heat exposure. However, there is limited research on urban heat exposure assessment approaches that provides fine-scale spatiotemporal heat exposure information, integrated with meteorological status and human collective exposure as they move about in cities, to enable proactive heat exposure mitigation measures. Smart city digital twins (SCDTs) provide a new potential avenue for addressing this gap, enabling fine spatiotemporal scales, human-infrastructure interaction modeling, and predictive and decision support capabilities. This study develops and tests~a SCDT for collective urban heat exposure assessment and forecasting. Meteorological sensors and computer vision were implemented in Columbus, Georgia to acquire temperature, humidity, and passersby count data,~which were combined into a collective temperature humidity index. A generalized additive model and~crowd simulation were employed to predict future heat exposure~based on accumulated data~and to support heat exposure mitigation efforts. The results demonstrate the potential of SCDT to enhance public safety by providing city officials with a tool for discovering, predicting and~mitigating community exposure to extreme heat.},

  abstract = {With the focus of smart construction project management, this paper presents a closed-loop digital twin framework under the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and data mining (DM) techniques. To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations. In future works, more complex cases with multiple data streams will be used to test the developed framework, and more detailed interpretations with the actual observations of construction activities will be given.},

  abstract = {In building performance simulation, occupant behavior contributes to large uncertainties, which often lead to considerable discrepancies between actual energy consumption and simulation results. This paper aims to extract occupant-behavior related electricity load patterns using classical K-means clustering approach at the initial investigation stage. Smart-metering data from a case study in Shanghai, China, was used for the load pattern analysis. The electricity load patterns of occupants were examined on a daily/weekly/seasonal basis. According to their load patterns, occupants were categorized as (a) white-collar workers, (b) poor or older families and (c) rich or young families. The daily patterns indicated that electricity use was much more random and fluctuated over a wide range. Most households of the monitored communities consumed relatively-low electricity; the characteristic double peak with higher level of consumption in the morning and evening were only apparent in a relatively small subset of residents (mostly white-collar workers). The weekly analysis found that significant load shifting towards weekend days occurred in the poor or old family group. The electricity saving potential was greatest in the white-collar workers and the rich or young family groups. This study concludes with recommendations to stakeholders utilizing our load profiling results. The research provides a rare insight into the electricity-use-related occupant behaviors of Shanghai residents through the case study of two communities. The findings of the study are also presented in a meaningful way so that they can directly aid the decision-making of governments and other stakeholders interested in energy efficiency. The research results are also relevant to the building energy simulation community as they are derived from observations, and thus can have the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of numerical simulation results.},

  abstract = {Ageing buildings have become a significant concern for many cities, exacerbated by inadequate management and maintenance of Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) systems. Building Information Modelling (BIM) enables efficient MEP Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) through the digital representation of system information; however, many ageing buildings were constructed without BIM, and manual reconstruction is costly and inefficient due to the sheer number of such structures. Although some studies have proposed methods for automatically recovering BIM from 2D drawings, few are suitable for MEP systems due to the multiscale and irregular shapes of MEP components. To fill this gap, an automatic approach is proposed for recovering MEP model from 2D drawings with three modules: 1) semantic extraction by combining image cropping with Cascade Mask R-CNN to detect and segment multiscale, irregular MEP components; 2) geometric extraction by semantic-assisted image processing to extract contours and skeletons of irregular parts; and 3) Industry Foundation Class (IFC)-based BIM reconstruction via the open-source pythonOCC and IfcOpenShell. The performance was tested on two MEP systems with 335 and 282 multiscale and irregular elements, and the results show that the method recovered BIMs for the two MEP systems in 2.85~s and 0.79~s, with semantic extraction accuracy exceeding 0.9 and geometric error below 5\%. This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing a semantic and geometric-based approach for recovering multiscale and irregular components from 2D drawings. Future studies could further improve the approach by integrating elevation drawings, reconstructing abstract symbols, and aligning text-geometry.},

  abstract = {Ageing buildings have become a significant concern for many cities, exacerbated by inadequate management and maintenance of Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) systems. Building Information Modelling (BIM) enables efficient MEP Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) through the digital representation of system information; however, many ageing buildings were constructed without BIM, and manual reconstruction is costly and inefficient due to the sheer number of such structures. Although some studies have proposed methods for automatically recovering BIM from 2D drawings, few are suitable for MEP systems due to the multiscale and irregular shapes of MEP components. To fill this gap, an automatic approach is proposed for recovering MEP model from 2D drawings with three modules: 1) semantic extraction by combining image cropping with Cascade Mask R-CNN to detect and segment multiscale, irregular MEP components; 2) geometric extraction by semantic-assisted image processing to extract contours and skeletons of irregular parts; and 3) Industry Foundation Class (IFC)-based BIM reconstruction via the open-source pythonOCC and IfcOpenShell. The performance was tested on two MEP systems with 335 and 282 multiscale and irregular elements, and the results show that the method recovered BIMs for the two MEP systems in 2.85~s and 0.79~s, with semantic extraction accuracy exceeding 0.9 and geometric error below 5\%. This paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing a semantic and geometric-based approach for recovering multiscale and irregular components from 2D drawings. Future studies could further improve the approach by integrating elevation drawings, reconstructing abstract symbols, and aligning text-geometry.},

  abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

  abstract = {Technologies for the acquisition, storage and mining of big data are increasingly affecting the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, modifying the way buildings are conceived and developed. Indeed, they will be no longer designed and managed only as financial products, but also as service providers to support the needs of the occupants. This is a great challenge in the building sector, that is experiencing a period of various (r)evolution concerning products, technologies and processes. This research defines a digitally enabled framework for operating cognitive buildings, presenting a case study by which it has been possible to analyze how information collected during operations could inform end-users (i.e. administrators, owners, facility managers and occupants) about the behavior of both buildings and occupants. Focusing on building in-use stages, advantages in tracking the behavior of occupants and in satisfying the needs of users should be derived through the availability of real-time information, i.e. collected by sensors. In this way, not only the behavior of users could be taken into account, but also predicted performance could be correlated with real measurement and, consequently, the building performance gap should be estimated and filled. A connection between as-designed virtual models (resulted from a BIM --- Building Information Modeling --- process) and as-delivered physical assets (monitored in real-time, i.e. through BMS --- Building Management Systems) could be established to explore how BIM practices and technologies could improve a data-driven asset management, by enriching building information in operation. The results should allow pointing out how data and information gathered along building life cycle could provide services to users.},

Most of these services are developed on top of advanced machine-learning algorithms, which rely heavily on datasets for training, testing, and validation purposes. A limitation of most existing datasets, however, is the scarcity of labels. The SustDataED2 dataset described in this paper contains 96 days of aggregated and individual appliance consumption from one household in Portugal. The current and voltage waveforms were sampled at 12.8\,kHz, and the individual consumption of 18 appliances was sampled at 0.5\,Hz. The dataset also contains the timestamps of the ON-OFF transitions of the monitored appliances for the entire deployment duration, providing the necessary ground truth for the evaluation of machine learning problems, particularly Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring. The data is accessible in easy-to-use audio and comma-separated formats.},

The simultaneous consideration of multiple and conflicting design objectives can make the architectural design process more complicated. This study is based on the fundamental recognition that optimising parameters on the building energy loads via window system design can reduce the quality of the view to outside and the received daylight -- both qualities highly valued by building occupants. This paper proposes an approach for quantifying Quality of View in office buildings in balance with energy performance and daylighting, thus enabling an optimisation framework for office window design. The study builds on previous research by developing a multi-objective method of assessment of a reference room which is parametrically modelled using actual climate data. A method of Pareto Frontier and a weighting sum is applied for multi-objective optimisation to determine best outcomes that balance design requirements. The Results reveal the maximum possible window to wall ratio for the reference room. The optimisation model indicates that the room geometry should be altered to achieve the lighting and view requirements set out in building performance standards. The research results emphasise the need for window system configuration to be considered in the early design stages. This exploratory approach to a methodology and framework considers both building parameters and the local climate condition. It has the potential to be adopted and further refined by other researchers and designers to support complex, multi-factorial design decision-making.},

It uses semantic graphs to automatically create the diagnostic model from the building's data points and to identify potential cause-effect-relationships based on past and current time series data. The approach is validated on various simulated examples of a multiroom HVAC control system.

  abstract = {Digital and intelligent buildings are critical to realizing efficient building energy operations and a smart grid. With the increasing digitalization of processes throughout the life cycle of buildings, data exchanged between stakeholders and between building systems have grown significantly. However, a lack of semantic interoperability between data in different systems is still prevalent and hinders the development of energy-oriented applications that can be reused across buildings, limiting the scalability of innovative solutions. Addressing this challenge, our review paper systematically reviews metadata schemas and ontologies that are at the foundation of semantic interoperability necessary to move toward improved building energy operations. The review finds 40 schemas that span different phases of the building life cycle, most of which cover commercial building operations and, in particular, control and monitoring systems. The paper's deeper review and analysis of five popular schemas identify several gaps in their ability to fully facilitate the work of a building modeler attempting to support three use cases: energy audits, automated fault detection and diagnosis, and optimal control. Our findings demonstrate that building modelers focused on energy use cases will find it difficult, labor intensive, and costly to create, sustain, and use semantic models with existing ontologies. This underscores the significant work still to be done to enable interoperable, usable, and maintainable building models. We make three recommendations for future work by the building modeling and energy communities: a centralized repository with a search engine for relevant schemas, the development of more use cases, and better harmonization and standardization of schemas in collaboration with industry to facilitate their adoption by stakeholders addressing varied energy-focused use cases.},

  abstract = {A critical step in the design of a Net-Zero Energy building is the reduction of energy consumption, so that consumption can be cost-effectively offset by renewable energy production. In this paper, we present a method to inform the design of Net-Zero Energy buildings through the identification of influential energy efficiency measures. A regression-based global sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the relative importance of both individual design parameters and bilinear interactions between parameters. This allows for the identification of the specific two-way interactions between parameter pairs, rather than an evaluation of the influence of interactions for each parameter in a lumped manner as is commonly used in building performance simulation. The relative importance of both building control and architectural design parameters are assessed, and are used to help evaluate the importance of utilizing an integrated design method for reducing building energy consumption. The case-study building investigated is a primary vaccine warehouse, a vital part of the vaccine cold chain in the developing world. As this building type has not received adequate attention in the field of building performance simulation, this paper makes a significant contribution towards an improved understanding of the energy efficient design of these warehouses.},

  abstract = {Buildings Automation Systems (BAS) are ubiquitous in contemporary buildings, both monitoring building conditions and managing the building system control points. At present, these controls are prescriptive and predetermined by the design team, rather than responsive to actual building performance. These are further limited by prescribed logic, possess only rudimentary visualizations, and lack broader system integration capabilities. Advances in machine learning, edge analytics, data management systems, and Facility Management-enabled Building Information Models (FM-BIMs) permit a novel approach: cloud-hosted building management. This paper presents an integration technique for mapping the data from a building Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network to an FM-BIM. The sensor data naming convention and time-series analysis strategies integrated into the data structure are discussed and presented, including the use of a 3D nested list to permit time-series data to be mapped to the FM-BIM and readily visualized. The developed approach is presented through a case study describing the scalability of the approach to integrate a building BAS system with a BIM. The resultant data structure and key visualizations are presented to demonstrate the value of this approach, which permits the enduser to select the desired timeframe for visualization and readily step through the spatio-temporal building performance data.},

  abstract = {Cohort Comfort Models (CCM) are introduced as a technique for creating a personalized thermal prediction for a new building occupant without the need to collect large amounts of individual comfort-related data. This approach leverages historical data collected from a sample population, who have some underlying preference similarity to the new occupant. The method uses background information such as physical and demographic characteristics and one-time onboarding surveys (satisfaction with life scale, highly sensitive person scale, personality traits) from the new occupant, as well as physiological and environmental sensor measurements paired with a few thermal preference responses. The framework was implemented using two personal comfort datasets containing longitudinal data from 55 people. The datasets comprise more than 6000 unique right-here-right-now thermal comfort surveys. The results show that a CCM that uses only the one-time onboarding survey information of an individual occupant has generally as good or better performance as compared to conventional general-purpose models, but uses no historical longitudinal data as compared to personalized models. If up to ten historical personal preference data points are used, CCM increased the thermal preference prediction by 8\% on average and up to 36\% for half of the occupants in the first of the tested datasets. In the second dataset, one-third of the occupants increased their thermal preference prediction by 5\% on average and up to 46\%. CCM can be an important step toward the development of personalized thermal comfort models without the need to collect a large number of datapoints per person.},

The distributed ledger and Blockchain technologies had brought solutions through transparently bridging two or multiple untrusted parties. In this research, a novel architecture for a smart building system, including a control system and automatic approaches, is proposed. An efficient cluster head selection algorithm is proposed to select the desired cluster head with the consideration of low energy consumption and fast head selection. An enhanced combination of IoT forwarding devices and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology is further advanced. Furthermore, the proposed ``DistBlockBuilding'' architecture is implemented for managing a safe and secure data transfer from one surface to another surface. Besides, Blockchain technology is performed for transferring data within the smart building. Finally, the performance of IoT-SDN based secured networks is evaluated.},

Nevertheless, the practical implementation of digital twins in the built environment remains a significant challenge. This paper describes a system that seamlessly integrates data into digital twins of built assets. The system uses a knowledge graph to achieve data integration, which is designed to be modular, flexible, and interoperable. The graph includes BIM models, metadata from an external IoT platform, and process-related information. The system is microservice-based and revolves around a graph database housing the knowledge graph. It employs dynamic operations to update the knowledge graph and is tested using civil engineering infrastructure examples. Results from this work can be used to create pipelines that extract and operate with data connecting computational agents integrated into the system as microservices or connected through the system API.},

The objective of this study is to present an approach that helps to develop a multi-criteria decision support tool dedicated to the rehabilitation of sustainable and passive energy housing by integrating heating energy needs, economic, social and environmental criteria throughout the life cycle stages of the building. The methodology consists of developing metamodels to predict heating energy needs from polynomial regression, design of experiments method and thermo-aeraulic simulations of building behavior. This metamodel is used to carry out a combinatorial study of real technical solutions. The methodology was applied to a real-life existing building located in La Rochelle city (France) based on an in-situ energy diagnosis. Three multicriteria analysis methods were studied and compared: weighted sum, Min-Max and Pareto concept. Furthermore, technical constraints as well as owner preferences and performance constraints have been studied. Optimal technical solutions have been obtained in order to meet the various criteria studied. In addition, window shading and natural ventilation have been proposed to reduce the thermal discomfort rate in summer. This study was extended to all French regions. Finally, this method can be transformed into a decision support tool which will be useful for architects, engineers and stockholders.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper deals with achieving both energy efficiency and comfortness in a particular room by controlling lighting and cooling appliances of a building by deploying modern sensors like Thermal sensors and Camera for accurate mapping of the environment parameters. The unique part of this paper is that a Sensor Fusion algorithm has been used in different segments of the room which combine the sensory output from the Thermal Sensor and Camera to ensure that the occupancy detection is done accurately with least amount of fluctuations without any delay. The two algorithms, namely, image processing algorithm and sensor signal processing runs in distributed computing environment in two different processors and the outputs of processing algorithms are received in the master controller through IoT cloud platform. The proposed image processing algorithm is effective in detecting both static and dynamic event changes using background subtraction and ROI based segregation models. The system develops the use of this sensor fusion algorithm to provide an intuitive control of the environment and improve the efficiency of the decision making process using National Instruments MyRIO 1800 and cRIO 9082 processors in LabVIEW platform which also reduces the chances or consequences of any fault occurring in the system.},

In this paper, we investigate this problem in the context of Gaussian Processes (GPs) and propose a new model which learns a mixture of latent processes by decomposing the covariance matrix into a sum of structured hidden components each of which is controlled by a latent GP over input features and a "weight" over tasks. From this sum structure, we propose a parallelizable parameter learning algorithm with a predetermined initialization for the "weights". We also notice that an ensemble parameter learning approach using mini-batches of training data not only reduces the computation complexity of learning but also improves the regression performance. We evaluate our model on two datasets, the smaller Swiss Jura dataset and another relatively larger ATMS dataset from NOAA. Substantial improvements are observed compared with established alternatives.},

MPC is becoming more and more viable because of the increase in computational power of building automation systems and the availability of a significant amount of monitored building data. MPC has found successful implementation in building thermal regulation, fully exploiting the potential of building thermal mass. Moreover, MPC has been positively applied to active energy storage systems, as well as to the optimal management of on-site renewable energy sources. MPC also opens up several opportunities for enhancing energy efficiency in the operation of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems because of its ability to consider constraints, prediction of disturbances and multiple conflicting objectives, such as indoor thermal comfort and building energy demand. Despite the application of MPC algorithms in building control has been thoroughly investigated in various works, a unified framework that fully describes and formulates the implementation is still lacking. Firstly, this work introduces a common dictionary and taxonomy that gives a common ground to all the engineering disciplines involved in building design and control. Secondly the main scope of this paper is to define the MPC formulation framework and critically discuss the outcomes of different existing MPC algorithms for building and HVAC system management. The potential benefits of the application of MPC in improving energy efficiency in buildings were highlighted.},

  abstract = {Nations have attempted to commit to the Kyoto Protocol and effectively reduce hazardous emissions through energy-efficient design techniques, strategies, and policies (optimized building orientation and location, and photovoltaic systems and green materials). However, there are shortcomings in achieving these goals. The Energy Efficiency Directive, Energy Performance Directive of Buildings, and Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers have recently focused on dynamic fa{\c c}ade design that can considerably contribute to energy-efficient building design and low-emission development. This study comprehensively investigates and identifies dynamic fa{\c c}ade typologies, technologies, and techniques while comparing and synthesizing them against architectural design, structural engineering, and material science. In particular, the study investigated the applications, functionalities, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) of dynamic fa{\c c}ades. In addition, the structural and architectural characteristics, environmental performance, and effectiveness of dynamic fa{\c c}ades (clustered into opaque, transparent, and semi-transparent surface types) have been explored and synthesized. The study concludes that applying the dynamic fa{\c c}ade concept entails challenges and opportunities for building developers, users, and auditors. Furthermore, dynamic fa{\c c}ade design is a trade-off between environmental analysis data (such as luminance and solar radiation) and user comfort and satisfaction with both the light and thermal intensity of external and internal environments. In addition, dynamic fa{\c c}ades can actively and selectively control the heat transfer and energy flow while potentially reducing the internal heating and cooling loads. Therefore, adaptive fa{\c c}ades are designed based on behavior changes at the micro-scale (i.e., material structure) or macro-scale (i.e., moving part configuration).},

In Iran, subsidy policies of energy supply have caused it to be more than 2.5 times of the global consumption. As a result, buildings' energy efficiency improvement must be considered important for Iranian designers and researchers. However, this issue has not received due attention yet. Thus, the present study aims to shed new light on the buildings' energy efficiency planning in Iran by adopting a multi-objective optimization-simulation model in order to provide a set of optimum possible solutions for improving the energy efficiency measures of buildings located in different climate zones of the country. The proposed model aims at determination of envelope materials, and types of active/passive cooling/heating systems to optimize the economic and environmental performance of the overall system. The model is applied to a building categorized as type-one according to the building occupancy typologies of national building regulations in Iran. Simulations are performed by BCS19 software in order to evaluate the quality of the Pareto optimal alternatives. Therefore, amendment of routines in designing buildings according to different climate conditions is proposed.},

  abstract = {A large-scale national survey of energy consumption and indoor environmental quality of rural housing was conducted in China. Its purpose was to obtain fundamental data and to analyze key problems related to the homes of approximately 600~million rural people. The survey results indicate that the total annual household energy consumption in rural China reached 317~million tons of standard coal equivalent (tce) (9.3~{\texttimes}~109~GJ), in the forms of 192~million tons of raw coal (4.0~{\texttimes}~109~GJ), 5.9~million tons of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (0.3~{\texttimes}~109~MJ), 132~billion~kWh of electricity (1.4~{\texttimes}~109~GJ), and 219~million tons of raw biomass (3.6~{\texttimes}~109~GJ). There is an upward trend in the use of coal for space heating and cooking, which is a significant source of air pollution. The pilot study of a program to provide passive energy savings in northern rural China was also conducted. Based on the results of actual demonstration projects, feasible intervention strategies for sustainable development in rural China are proposed, with the goal of achieving ``zero coal villages''. Projections show that achieving ``zero coal villages'' nationwide could provide huge and permanent benefits both to China and to the rest of the world. The results obtained from this study could also provide guidance for development of rural housing in other countries, particularly in the developing world.},

Within this scope, this paper focuses on a domain-specific semantic-enrichment of BIM methodology, aimed at fulfilling semantic representation requirements of built heritage through Semantic Web technologies. To develop this semantic-enriched BIM approach, this research relies on the integration of a BIM environment with a knowledge base created through information ontologies. The result is knowledge base system - and a prototypal platform - that enhances semantic representation capabilities of BIM application to architectural heritage processes. It solves the issue of knowledge formalization in cultural heritage informative models, favouring a deeper comprehension and interpretation of all the building aspects. Its open structure allows future research to customize, scale and adapt the knowledge base different typologies of artefacts and heritage activities.},

  abstract = {While optimization studies focusing on real-world buildings are somewhat limited, many building optimization studies to date have used simple hypothetical buildings for the following three reasons: (1) the shape and form of real buildings are complex and difficult to mathematically describe; (2) computer models built based on real buildings are computationally expensive, which makes the optimization process time-consuming and impractical and (3) although algorithm performance is crucial for achieving effective building performance optimization (BPO), there is a lack of agreement regarding the proper selection of optimization algorithms and algorithm control parameters. This study applied BPO to the design of a newly built complex building. A number of design variables, including the shape of the building's eaves, were optimized to improve building energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort. Instead of using a detailed simulation model, a surrogate model developed by an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to reduce the computing time. In this study, the performance of four multi-objective algorithms was evaluated by using the proposed performance evaluation criteria to select the best algorithm and parameter values for population size and number of generations. The performance evaluation results of the algorithms implied that NSGA-II (with a population size and number of generations of 40 and 45, respectively) performed the best in the case study. The final optimal solution significantly improves building performance, demonstrating the success of the BPO technique in solving complex building design problems. In addition, the findings on the performance evaluation of the algorithms provide guidance for users regarding the selection of suitable algorithms and parameter settings based on the most important performance criteria.},

  abstract = {Today, simulation tools are widely used to design buildings because their energy performance is increasing. Simulation is used at different stages to predict the building's energy performance and to improve the thermal comfort of its occupants, but also to reduce the environmental impact of the building over its whole life cycle and lower the cost of construction and operation. Simulation has become an essential decision support tool, but its reliability should not be overlooked. It is important to evaluate the reliability of simulation and measurement as well as uncertainty so as to improve building design. This work aimed to evaluate and order the uncertainty of the simulation results during the design process. A three-step methodology was developed to determine influential parameters in the building's energy performance and to identify the influence of parameter uncertainty on the building performance. This methodology was applied at the INCAS experimental platform of the French National Institute of Solar Energy (INES) in Le-Bourget-du-Lac to identify and measure the uncertainty in a simulation hypothesis. The method can be used during the entire design process of a building, from preliminary sketches to operating phase.},

  abstract = {Buildings directly and indirectly emit a large share of current CO2 emissions. There is a high potential for CO2 savings through modern control methods in building automation systems (BAS) like model predictive control (MPC). For a proper control, MPC needs mathematical models to predict the future behavior of the controlled system. For this purpose, digital twins of the building can be used. However, with current methods in existing buildings, a digital twin set up is usually labor-intensive. Especially connecting the different components of the technical system to an overall digital twin of the building is time-consuming. Piping and instrument diagrams (P\&ID) can provide the needed information, but it is necessary to extract the information and provide it in a standardized format to process it further.  In this work, we present an approach to recognize symbols and connections of P\&ID from buildings in a completely automated way. There are various standards for graphical representation of symbols in P\&ID of building energy systems. Therefore, we use different data sources and standards to generate a holistic training data set. We apply algorithms for symbol recognition, line recognition and derivation of connections to the data sets. Furthermore, the result is exported to a format that provides semantics of building energy systems.  The symbol recognition, line recognition and connection recognition show good results with an average precision of 93.7\%, which can be used in further processes like control generation, (distributed) model predictive control or fault detection. Nevertheless, the approach needs further research.},

  abstract = {Multimedia applications often require concurrent solutions to multiple tasks. These tasks hold clues to each-others solutions, however as these relations can be complex this remains a rarely utilized property. When task relations are explicitly defined based on domain knowledge multi-task learning (MTL) offers such concurrent solutions, while exploiting relatedness between multiple tasks performed over the same dataset. In most cases however, this relatedness is not explicitly defined and the domain expert knowledge that defines it is not available. To address this issue, we introduce Selective Sharing, a method that learns the inter-task relatedness from secondary latent features while the model trains. Using this insight, we can automatically group tasks and allow them to share knowledge in a mutually beneficial way. We support our method with experiments on 5 datasets in classification, regression, and ranking tasks and compare to strong baselines and state-of-the-art approaches showing a consistent improvement in terms of accuracy and parameter counts. In addition, we perform an activation region analysis showing how Selective Sharing affects the learned representation.},

We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.},

  abstract = {A promising alternative to standard control strategies for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and blinds positioning of buildings is Model Predictive Control (MPC). Key to MPC is having a sufficiently simple (preferably linear) model of the building's thermal dynamics. In this paper we propose and test a general approach to derive MPC compatible models consisting of the following steps: First, we use standard geometry and construction data to derive in an automated way a physical first-principles based linear model of the building's thermal dynamics. This describes the evolution of room, wall, floor and ceiling temperatures on a per zone level as a function of external heat fluxes (e.g., solar gains, heating/cooling system heat fluxes etc.). Second, we model the external heat fluxes as linear functions of control inputs and predictable disturbances. Third, we tune a limited number of physically meaningful parameters. Finally, we use model reduction to derive a low-order model that is suitable for MPC. The full-scale and low-order models were tuned with and compared to a validated EnergyPlus building simulation software model. The approach was successfully applied to the modeling of a representative Swiss office building. The proposed modular approach flexibly supports stepwise model refinements and integration of models for the building's technical subsystems.},

  abstract = {The energy performance of buildings especially public buildings needs to be optimized together with environmental, social and cost performance, which can be achieved by the multiobjective optimization method. The traditional building performance simulation (BPS) based multiobjective optimization is time-consuming and inefficient. Practical projects of complex public building design usually involve many-objective optimization problems in which more than three objectives are considered. Using BPS based multiobjective optimization is not sufficient to solve this kind of design problem. This paper aims to propose an artificial neural network (ANN) based many-objective optimization design method, an architect-friendly integrated workflow has been implemented. The proposed method has been applied on a public library building in Changchun city of China to optimize its Energy Use Intensity (EUI), Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA), Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) and Building Envelope Cost (BEC). The optimization process has obtained 176 non-dominated solutions. By adopting the selected relative optimal solutions, 1.6x10(5)-2.1x10(5) kWh energy can be saved per year; sDA value and UDI value can be increased by 8.1\%-11.0\% and 4.3\%-4.7\% respectively; BEC can be reduced by yen1.2x10(5)-2.1x10(5) (\$1.7x10(4)-3.0x10(4)). The optimization time has been greatly shortened in this method and the whole process is highly efficient without manual data conversion between different platforms.},

To enhance robustness, self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a vital tool for data augmentation. Traditional methods often depend on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness when labeled data is scarce. Our research tackles this by advancing graph model generalization in zero-shot learning environments. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we aim to create a graph-oriented LLM capable of exceptional generalization across various datasets and tasks without relying on downstream graph data. We introduce the GraphGPT framework, which integrates LLMs with graph structural knowledge through graph instruction tuning. This framework includes a text-graph grounding component to link textual and graph structures and a dual-stage instruction tuning approach with a lightweight graph-text alignment projector. These innovations allow LLMs to comprehend complex graph structures and enhance adaptability across diverse datasets and tasks. Our framework demonstrates superior generalization in both supervised and zero-shot graph learning tasks, surpassing existing benchmarks. The open-sourced model implementation of our GraphGPT is available at https://github.com/HKUDS/GraphGPT.},

  abstract = {Solar energy can be exploited efficiently in building fa{\c c}ades using building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). This study presents a methodology to optimize the design of fixed, parametrically modelled PV integrated shading devices (PVSDs) based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) coupled with integrated thermal, electric, and lighting simulations. The goal of this work is to gain insight into the potential benefits of using optimization algorithms for PVSD design. This task is carried out by evaluating the extent to which competing solar energy uses can be balanced with regard to thermal, visual and electrical parameters; and investigating whether existing simulation tools successfully characterize the complexity associated with PVSDs. The methodology developed is used to design and assess the performance of different optimized configurations of a fixed exterior louvre PVSD installed on the southern face of an office building in a Nordic climate. The parameters used for the optimization were the number of louvre-blades as well as their individual tilt angle and position along the vertical axis. This allowed the introduction of a higher degree of eclecticism through the optimization process compared to standard shading systems. The three objectives of the optimization were the total net energy demand, the energy converted by the PV material, and the daylighting level in the zone measured as the continuous daylight autonomy. The results highlighted that configurations with smaller louvres counts were preferable for the specific case study and that optimization increased the performance of the PVSD compared to a reference case. The results of the study also demonstrated that the application of the proposed methodology was able to improve the exploitation of solar energy through a multi-domain fa{\c c}ade, and thereby that advanced simulation tools, in this case, allowed overcoming the limitations of more standardized fa{\c c}ade configurations. Based on these findings, it is assumed that methodologies like the one developed in this article can be a starting point to stimulate successful discussion and foster fruitful collaboration between researchers, stakeholders, and fa{\c c}ade manufacturers, resulting in the development of innovative technological solar integrated fa{\c c}ade solutions.},

  abstract = {Advanced building envelopes (ABEs) are innovative integrated systems that aim to increase the sustainability of buildings by providing flexible and efficient energy management solutions while safeguarding healthy and comfortable indoor environments. These building envelopes operate at the cross-section of architecture, engineering and data science, often involving transient multi-physical parameters and advanced material properties. The development of ABEs has increasingly relied on building performance simulation (BPS) tools to improve the understanding and management of their complex interrelationships. However, this complexity has sometimes shown to constitute barriers for their real-world implementation, in part caused by the limitations of monolithic legacy BPS tools. One of the most promising alternatives to overcoming these difficulties has been to use co-simulation. Co-simulation allows modelers to use multiple sub-models and link them to enable simultaneous data exchange during simulation runtime. This approach provides added possibilities for implementing advanced control strategies, integrating innovative data-driven inputs, and creating collaborative interdisciplinary and evolutive workflows for building envelopes at different stages and scales in projects. This article provides a critical overview of the possibilities that co-simulation approaches offer to improve performance assessments of advanced building envelopes. This article also presents current barriers to co-simulation and discusses critical elements to overcome them. Ongoing trends in BPS and information and communication technologies are highlighted, emphasizing how they transform the field and create new opportunities for modelers working in research and industry.},

The window sizes resulting in best energy performance for double and triple glazing were as small as daylight requirements allow, 22-24\% respectively. For quadruple and hypothetical quintuple glazing the optimal window-to-wall ratios were larger, about 40\% and 60\% respectively, because of daylight utilization and good solar factor naturally provided by so many panes. The cost optimal facade solution was highly transparent triple low emissivity glazing with window-to-wall ratios of about 25\% and external wall insulation thickness of 200 mm (U=0.16). Dynamic external shading gave positive effect on energy performance only in case of large window sizes whereas due to high investment cost it was not financially feasible. Limited number of simulations with Central European climate showed that triple glazing with double low emissivity coating and window-to-wall ratio of about 40\%, i.e. slightly larger and with external shading compared to Estonian cost optimal one, clearly outperformed conventional design.

  abstract = {Efficient energy consumption is crucial for achieving sustainable energy goals in the era of climate change and grid modernization. Thus, it is vital to understand how energy is consumed at finer resolutions such as household in order to plan demand-response events or analyze impacts of weather, electricity prices, electric vehicles, solar, and occupancy schedules on energy consumption. However, availability and access to detailed energy-use data, which would enable detailed studies, has been rare. In this paper, we release a unique, large-scale, digital-twin of residential energy-use dataset for the residential sector across the contiguous United States covering millions of households. The data comprise of hourly energy use profiles for synthetic households, disaggregated into Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCL) and appliance use. The underlying framework is constructed using a bottom-up approach. Diverse open-source surveys and first principles models are used for end-use modeling. Extensive validation of the synthetic dataset has been conducted through comparisons with reported energy-use data. We present a detailed, open, high resolution, residential energy-use dataset for the United States.},

A model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed to optimize Mi-croCSP electrical and thermal energy flows for HVAC use in a building. Despite its attractiveness regarding energy savings and thermal comfort satisfaction, MPC requires high computational resources and can not be easily implemented on the common low-cost HVAC controllers available in the market. To cope with these issues, two MPC-trained adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models are designed to control the building HVAC with MicroCSP. Simulation results exploiting real operation data from an office building at Michigan Technological University and our newly purchased MicroCSP are presented. It is shown that the resulting controller can reproduce the MPC reasoning and performance while being simpler and much more computationally efficient.},

  abstract = {Behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), including building solar photovoltaic (PV) technology and electric battery storage, are increasingly being considered as solutions to support carbon reduction goals and increase grid reliability and resiliency. However, dynamic control of these resources in concert with traditional building loads, to effect efficiency and demand flexibility, is not yet commonplace in commercial control products. Traditional rule-based control algorithms do not offer integrated closed-loop control to optimize across systems, and most often, PV and battery systems are operated for energy arbitrage and demand charge management, and not for the provision of grid services. More advanced control approaches, such as MPC control have not been widely adopted in industry because they require significant expertise to develop and deploy. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer a promising option to optimize the operation of DER systems and building loads with reduced setup effort. However, there are limited studies that evaluate the efficacy of these methods to control multiple building subsystems simultaneously. Additionally, most of the research has been conducted in simulated environments as opposed to real buildings. This paper proposes a DRL approach that uses a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for integrated control of HVAC and electric battery storage systems in the presence of on-site PV generation. The DRL algorithm, trained on synthetic data, was deployed in a physical test building and evaluated against a baseline that uses the current best-in-class rule-based control strategies. Performance in delivering energy efficiency, load shift, and load shed was tested using price-based signals. The results showed that the DRL-based controller can produce cost savings of up to 39.6\% as compared to the baseline controller, while maintaining similar thermal comfort in the building. The project team has also integrated the simulation components developed during this work as an OpenAIGym environment and made it publicly available so that prospective DRL researchers can leverage this environment to evaluate alternate DRL algorithms.},

A back propagation neural network algorithm has been preferred and both simulation tools were applied to 148 residential buildings selected from 3 municipalities of Izmir-Turkey. Under the given conditions, a good coherence was observed between artificial neural network and building energy simulation tool results with a mean absolute percentage error of 5.06\% and successful prediction rate of 0.977. The advantages of ANN model over the energy simulation software are observed as the simplicity, the speed of calculation and learning from the limited data sets.},

Data interoperability is a key component to eliminate silos of information, and using semantic web technologies like the BRICK schema, an effort to standardize semantic descriptions of the physical, logical, and virtual assets in buildings and the relationships between them, is a suitable approach. However, current data integration processes can involve significant manual interventions. This paper presents a methodology to automatically collect, assemble, and integrate information from a building information model to a knowledge graph. The resulting application, called BIM-to-BRICK, is run on the SDE4 building located in Singapore. BIM-to-BRICK generated a bidirectional link between a BIM model of 932 instances and experimental data collected for 17 subjects into 458 BRICK objects and 1219 relationships in 17 seconds. The automation of this approach can be compared to traditional manual mapping of data types.

We developed an open-source simulation environment, AlphaBuilding ResCommunity, that can be used to train and validate algorithms to control a single thermostatically controlled load (TCL) or coordinate a group of TCLs. We used reduced-order models to simulate the thermodynamics of TCLs, and the parameter values were determined from the connected smart thermostat data of real households. The environment was built upon the standardized OpenAI Gym interface. Ancillary functions, such as retrieving the parameters and weather forecasts, are provided to facilitate control strategies that require predictive information. Compared with existing efforts, AlphaBuilding ResCommunity has three advantages: (1) more realistic model settings because the parameter values are identified from actual household operating data, and modelling and measurement uncertainty are considered; (2) passive thermal storage control; and (3) ease of use due to a simple software dependency and standardized interface. We demonstrated the applications of the environment by implementing a Kalman Filter and Model Predictive Control on a single TCL and a Priority-Stack-Based Control and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to coordinate multiple TCLs for load tracking.},

  abstract = {Building thermal load prediction informs the optimization of cooling plant and thermal energy storage. Physics-based prediction models of building thermal load are constrained by the model and input complexity. In this study, we developed 12 data-driven models (7 shallow learning, 2 deep learning, and 3 heuristic methods) to predict building thermal load and compared shallow machine learning and deep learning. The 12 prediction models were compared with the measured cooling demand. It was found XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boost) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) provided the most accurate load prediction in the shallow and deep learning category, and both outperformed the best baseline model, which uses the previous day's data for prediction. Then, we discussed how the prediction horizon and input uncertainty would influence the load prediction accuracy. Major conclusions are twofold: first, LSTM performs well in short-term prediction (1~h ahead) but not in long term prediction (24~h ahead), because the sequential information becomes less relevant and accordingly not so useful when the prediction horizon is long. Second, the presence of weather forecast uncertainty deteriorates XGBoost's accuracy and favors LSTM, because the sequential information makes the model more robust to input uncertainty. Training the model with the uncertain rather than accurate weather data could enhance the model's robustness. Our findings have two implications for practice. First, LSTM is recommended for short-term load prediction given that weather forecast uncertainty is unavoidable. Second, XGBoost is recommended for long term prediction, and the model should be trained with the presence of input uncertainty.},

Useful rule-checking systems could contribute to a quicker project delivery time. Currently, an efficient method for checking the logical relationship is still lacking. This study aims to propose an MEP rule checking framework using the subgraph matching technology. First, the MEP components in the BIM model are extracted by utilizing the application programming interface (API), and a graph database is established with point-based and curve-based instances being nodes and relationships, respectively.

Finally, rule checking is achieved by comparing the graph database against the knowledge graph, and the critical path in a sub-system is detected by calculating the betweenness centrality. A case study with a rail station is used to evaluate the approach where the overall model checking and rule checking are conducted on the original and simplified graph databases sequentially. The results show that the proposed approach could achieve the rule compliance checking at a high speed, and 6 unconnected instances along with 155 problematic pipe fittings have been found.

  abstract = {Thermal discomfort is a widespread problem in the built environment, due in part to the variability of individual occupants' thermal preferences. Personal comfort systems (PCS) address this individual variability, and also enable more energy-efficient thermal conditioning in buildings by reducing the need for tight indoor temperature control. This study evaluates a novel approach to PCS that leverages the time-dependence of human thermal perception. A 6.25\,cm2 wearable device, Embr Wave, delivers dynamic waveforms of cooling or warming to the inner wrist. In three thermal comfort tests conducted in a climate chamber with N\,=\,49 subjects and temperatures between 20 and 28\,{$^\circ$}C, the device exhibited a corrective potential of 2.5\,{$^\circ$}C within 3\,min for both warm and cool populations, while consuming {\textasciitilde}1\,W of power. The effect is even more pronounced (corrective potential up to 3.3\,{$^\circ$}C over periods of 3- and 45-min) when subjects are given control of the device's operation. Subjects are found to optimize the device settings for pleasantness, not for the intensity of sensation. These results indicate that this low-power, wearable device improves whole-body thermal sensation, comfort, and pleasantness. It is an appropriate tool for addressing the problem of thermal discomfort in moderate indoor environments.},

  abstract = {A carefully chosen indoor comfort temperature as the thermostat set-point is the key to optimizing building energy use and occupants' comfort and well-being. ASHRAE Standard 55 or ISO Standard 7730 uses the PMV-PPD model or the adaptive comfort model that is based on small-sized or outdated sample data, which raises questions on whether and how ranges of occupant thermal comfort temperature should be revised using more recent larger-sized dataset. In this paper, a Bayesian inference approach has been used to derive new occupant comfort temperature ranges for U.S. office buildings using the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database. Bayesian inference can express uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge. The comfort temperatures were found to be higher and less variable at cooling mode than at heating mode, and with significant overlapped variation ranges between the two modes. The comfort operative temperature of occupants varies between 21.9 and 25.4~{$^\circ$}C for the cooling mode with a median of 23.7~{$^\circ$}C, and between 20.5 and 24.9~{$^\circ$}C for the heating mode with a median of 22.7~{$^\circ$}C. These comfort temperature ranges are similar to the current ASHRAE standard 55 in the heating mode but 2--3~{$^\circ$}C lower in the cooling mode. The results of this study could be adopted as more realistic thermostat set-points in building design, operation, control optimization, energy performance analysis, and policymaking.},

  abstract = {Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems are gradually gaining popularity in small and medium-sized commercial and residential buildings owing to their high part-load performance, flexible control, and ease of installation and maintenance. Developing models of VRF systems to predict their performance are important for model-based control, fault diagnostic and detection. There are VRF models published in existing literatures, however those models were developed and validated in different datasets. As a result, the model accuracy cannot be directly compared. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing VRF models, and summarizes the input/output parameters and mathematical formulas of 16 VRF models from literature (referred to as physics-based model). Next, we validate and compare the model accuracy of existing models using the same dataset. Additionally, we develop data-driven models using the state-of-art machine learning algorithms, and compare the model accuracy between existing physics-based models with data-driven models. We find the model proposed by Hu et al. in 2019, which regresses the VRF cooling capacity and COP as a linear combination of indoor and outdoor temperatures times a cubed polynomial function of compressor frequency, is the most accurate physics-based model, with a prediction error of 22.19\% in the training dataset and 22.44\% in the validation dataset. XGBoost is the most accurate data-driven model, with a prediction error of 19.29\% in the training dataset and 22.02\% in the validation dataset. The data-driven model is more accurate while the physics-based model is more generalizable. The findings of this study can help researchers to select the proper VRF model for building energy prediction, model-based optimization, and fault diagnostic and detection.},

  abstract = {Accurate electricity demand forecasts that account for impacts of extreme weather events are needed to inform electric grid operation and utility resource planning, as well as to enhance energy security and grid resilience. Three common data-driven models are used to predict city-scale daily electricity usage: linear regression models, machine learning models for time series data, and machine learning models for tabular data. In this study, we developed and compared seven data-driven models: (1) five-parameter change-point model, (2) Heating/Cooling Degree Hour model, (3) time series decomposed model implemented by Facebook Prophet, (4) Gradient Boosting Machine implemented by Microsoft lightGBM, and (5) three widely-used machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network). Seven models are applied to the city-scale electricity usage data for three metropolitan areas in the United States: Sacramento, Los Angeles, and New York. Results show seven models can predict the metropolitan area's daily electricity use, with a coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) less than 10\%. The lightGBM provides the most accurate results, with CVRMSE on the test dataset of 6.5\% for Los Angeles, 4.6\% for Sacramento, and 4.1\% for the New York metropolitan area. These models are further applied to explore how extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves) and unexpected public health events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) influence each city's electricity demand. Results show weather-sensitive component accounts for 30\%--50\% of the total daily electricity usage. Every degree Celsius ambient temperature increase in summer leads to about 5\% (4.7\% in Los Angeles, 6.2\% in Sacramento, and 5.1\% in New York) more daily electricity usage compared with the base load in the three metropolitan areas. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced city-scale electricity demand: compared with the pre-pandemic same months in 2019, daily electricity usage during the 2020 pandemic decreased by 10\% in April and started to rebound in summer.},

  abstract = {Different thermal demands and preferences between individuals lead to a low occupant satisfaction rate, despite the high energy consumption by HVAC system. This study aims to quantify the difference in thermal demands, and to compare the influential factors which might lead to those differences. With the recently released ASHRAE Database, we quantitatively answered the following two research questions: which factors would lead to marked individual difference, and what the magnitude of this difference is. Linear regression has been applied to describe the macro-trend of how people feel thermally under different temperatures. Three types of factors which might lead to different thermal demands have been studied and compared in this study, i.e. individual factors, building characteristics and geographical factors. It was found that the local climate has the most marked impact on the neutral temperature, with an effect size of 3.5~{$^\circ$}C; followed by country, HVAC operation mode and body built, which lead to a difference of more than 1~{$^\circ$}C. In terms of the thermal sensitivity, building type and local climate are the most influential factors. Subjects in residential buildings or coming from Dry climate zone could accept 2.5~{$^\circ$}C wider temperature range than those in office, education buildings or from Continental climate zone. The findings of this research could help thermal comfort researchers and designers to identify influential factors that might lead to individual difference, and could shed light on the feature selection for the development of personal comfort models.},

  abstract = {Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is an excellent renewable energy application for building envelopes. In Australia, BIPV roofing is considered to be promising because of recent major concerns about fire risks of fa{\c c}ades. However, the integration of PV into building envelope elements is a complicated process which, if not done properly, may lead to failure of the BIPV system. Therefore, feasible BIPV design solutions need to be examined in terms of life-cycle cost and energy performance from the early design phase of a BIPV envelope project. There have been few investigations of the identification of feasible BIPV design options in the early design phase to enable product selection and parametric tests. This study explores a multi-objective optimization method which formulates feasible BIPV envelope design options which have relatively high energy generation and low life cycle costs to informed decision making. The optimisation process has four segments: data inputs, simulator, optimizer and pareto front based optimised BIPV solutions. The proposed multi- objective optimization process is applied in a BIPV roof application using a case study in Australia with roof sheets and skylights. The results demonstrate seven optimum roof sheet BIPV design solutions and fourteen optimum skylight BIPV design solutions to enable design makers to compare and select the most appropriate. The life cycle cost, life cycle energy, CO2 emissions avoided, net present value, payback period, and levelized cost of energy of BIPV solutions vary based on the BIPV modules, tilt angles and placement locations. The proposed optimization method is a helpful guide for BIPV design professionals to identify suitable BIPV design options in the early design phase instead of relying on rule-of-thumb experience.},

  abstract = {To replicate the success of text-to-image (T2I) generation, recent works employ large-scale video datasets to train a text-to-video (T2V) generator. Despite their promising results, such paradigm is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a new T2V generation setting\${\textbackslash}unicode\{x2014\}\$One-Shot Video Tuning, where only one text-video pair is presented. Our model is built on state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models pre-trained on massive image data. We make two key observations: 1) T2I models can generate still images that represent verb terms; 2) extending T2I models to generate multiple images concurrently exhibits surprisingly good content consistency. To further learn continuous motion, we introduce Tune-A-Video, which involves a tailored spatio-temporal attention mechanism and an efficient one-shot tuning strategy. At inference, we employ DDIM inversion to provide structure guidance for sampling. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of our method across various applications.},

  abstract = {Multi-output regression aims at learning a mapping from a multivariate input feature space to a multivariate output space. Despite its potential usefulness, the standard formulation of the least-squares support vector regression machine (LS-SVR) cannot cope with the multi-output case. The usual procedure is to train multiple independent LS-SVR, thus disregarding the underlying (potentially nonlinear) cross relatedness among different outputs. To address this problem, inspired by the multi-task learning methods, this study proposes a novel approach, Multi-output LS-SVR (MLS-SVR), in multi-output setting. Furthermore, a more efficient training algorithm is also given. Finally, extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {The aim of multi-output learning is to simultaneously predict multiple outputs given an input. It is an important learning problem for decision-making since making decisions in the real world often involves multiple complex factors and criteria. In recent times, an increasing number of research studies have focused on ways to predict multiple outputs at once. Such efforts have transpired in different forms according to the particular multi-output learning problem under study. Classic cases of multi-output learning include multi-label learning, multi-dimensional learning, multi-target regression, and others. From our survey of the topic, we were struck by a lack in studies that generalize the different forms of multi-output learning into a common framework. This article fills that gap with a comprehensive review and analysis of the multi-output learning paradigm. In particular, we characterize the four Vs of multi-output learning, i.e., volume, velocity, variety, and veracity, and the ways in which the four Vs both benefit and bring challenges to multi-output learning by taking inspiration from big data. We analyze the life cycle of output labeling, present the main mathematical definitions of multi-output learning, and examine the field's key challenges and corresponding solutions as found in the literature. Several model evaluation metrics and popular data repositories are also discussed. Last but not least, we highlight some emerging challenges with multi-output learning from the perspective of the four Vs as potential research directions worthy of further studies.},

This paper presents a new approach and its software implementation for the development of building design objects with semantics of interoperable information to support semantic interoperability in building designs. The novelty of the approach includes its incorporation of building design domain ontology, object-based CAD information modeling, and interoperability standard to make building information models and model data semantically interoperable. A set of methods are proposed to address the issues of object-based building information representation compliant with the Industrial Foundation Classes (IFC); extension of IFC models with the supplementary information; and semantic annotation of the interoperable and extensible information sets. The prototype implementation of these methods provides a set of Web-enabled software tools for effectively generating, managing, and reusing the semantically interoperable building objects in design applications of architectural CAD, structural analysis, and building code conformance checking.},

  abstract = {Reliable, affordable and sustainable supply of energy is of paramount importance. This can be achieved by designing and implementing hybrid renewable energy systems, also known as micro/smart-grids. The main goal of this study is the techno-economic and environmental multi-objective optimization of a decentralized energy system to provide electrical and thermal loads of a large energy consuming complex with daily average electric and thermal loads of 38.7 and 99.4 MWh, respectively. Pareto-optimal mix of several renewable and non-renewable technologies including photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), two types of combined heat and power technologies, namely micro-gas turbine (MGT) and fuel cell (FC), grid power, electrolyzer, hydrogen tank (Htank), battery and inverter is investigated. For this purpose, different configuration of these units were simulated in HOMER software, and the exact Pareto set was found by developing a MATLAB code. A total of 1945 optimal non-dominated designs including 11 stand-alone and 41 grid-connected configurations were found, in which the dominant configuration was PV/FC/Electrolyzer/Htank/Battery/Inverter/20\%Grid. The Pareto sets included systems with a wide variety of characteristics; the range (average) of net present cost (NPC), loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and carbon dioxide emissions (CE) were 26.9--44.0 (36.1) M\$, 0--10 (5.7)\% and 8800.9--13649.2 (9790.4) tons/yr for off-grid scenario and 17.2--37.5 (27.2) M\$, 0--10 (4.3)\% and 11215.1--17968.2 (13476.1) tons/yr for on-grid scenario, respectively. The TOPSIS combined with weighting methods was introduced to choose final design among non-dominated solutions set. At last, sensitivity analysis revealed that the most significant variables on the NPC of the selected micro-grids are real interest rate, investment costs, electric and thermal loads and level of irradiation, respectively.},

  abstract = {Construction project stakeholders often have to retrieve the required information in Building Information Models (BIMs) to support their design, engineering, and management activities. Natural language interface (NLI) systems are emerging as a time- and cost-effective way to query complex BIM models. However, the existing attempts cannot logically combine different constraints to perform fine-grained queries, dampening the usability of BIM-oriented NLIs. This paper presents a novel ontology-aided semantic parser to automatically map natural language queries (NLQs) that contain different attribute and relational constraints into computer-readable codes for BIM model retrieval in the context of building project development. A modular ontology was first developed to represent natural language expressions of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) concepts, relationships, and reasoning rules; it was then populated with entities from target BIM models to assimilate project-specific information. After that, the ontology-aided semantic parser progressively extracts concepts, relationships, and value restrictions from NLQs to identify multi-level constraint conditions, resulting in standard SPARQL queries to successfully retrieve IFC-based BIM models. The approach was evaluated based on 225 NLQs collected from BIM users, with a 91\% accuracy rate. Finally, a case study about the design-checking of a real-world residential building demonstrates the practicability of the proposed method in the construction industry.},

  abstract = {The employ of thermal insulation is one of the most effective ways of building energy conservation for cooling and heating. Therefore, the selection of a proper insulation material and the determination of optimum insulation thickness are particularly vital. Four typical cities of Shanghai, Changsha, Shaoguan and Chengdu are selected to represent A, B, C and D subzone of hot summer and cold winter zone in China, respectively. The Optimum thicknesses of five insulation materials including expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, foamed polyurethane, perlite and foamed polyvinyl chloride are Calculated with a typical residential wall using solar-air cooling and heating degree-days analysis and P(1)-P(2) economic model. And then, life cycle total costs, life cycle savings and payback periods are calculated based on life cycle cost analysis. Considering different orientations, surface colors, insulation materials and climates, optimum thicknesses of the five insulations vary from 0.053 to 0.236 m, and the payback periods vary from 1.9 to 4.7 years over a lifetime of 20 years. The maximum life cycle savings are 54.4 \$/m(2) in Shanghai, 54.8 \$/m(2) in Changsha and 41.5 \$/m(2) in Shaoguan (with a deep-colored northeast wall), and 39.0 \$/m(2) in Chengdu (with a light-colored northwest wall). Finally, an approach to analyze economical efficiency of insulation materials is developed, result shows that expanded polystyrene is the most economic insulation material of the five because of the highest life cycle saving and lowest payback period.

  abstract = {In the last decade there is numerous in in demand of simulation modelling for various use cases and especially during Covid-19 crisis. With development of modern ICT and machine learning algorithms there is also opportunities for more comprehensive analysis and simulation modelling. Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning algorithms as well as Big Data and computing technologies define background and prerequisites for development of digital twin as phenomena. Research includes analysis of application of existing methodologies for development of digital twin in strategic communication. This paper proposes also new methodology for development and evaluation process which is incorporation of already scientifically proved methods and next step forward for more unified process in simulation development.},

  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a promising technique for energy efficient control of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, the need for human involvement limits current MPC strategies from widespread deployment, since (i) model identification algorithms require re-tuning of hyper-parameters, and (ii) optimizers may fail to converge within the available control computation time, or get stuck in a local minimum. In this work we propose an autonomous MPC scheme to overcome these issues. Two major features are embedded in this architecture to enable autonomy: (i) a convex identification algorithm with adaptation to time-varying building dynamics, and (ii) a convex optimizer. The model identification algorithm re-runs periodically so as to handle changes in the building's dynamics. The estimated model is guaranteed to be stable and has desirable physical properties. The optimizer uses a descent and convergent algorithm, with the underlying optimization problem being feasible and convex. Numerical results show that the proposed convex formulation is more reliable in control computation compared to the nonconvex one, and the proposed autonomous MPC architecture reduces energy consumption significantly over a conventional controller.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Building information modelling (BIM) provides architectural 3D visualization and a standardized way to share and exchange building information. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using BIM, not only for design and construction, but also the post-construction management of the built facility. With the emergence of smart built environment (SBE) technology, which embeds most spaces with smart objects to enhance the building's efficiency, security and comfort of its occupants, there is a need to understand and address the challenges BIM faces in the design, construction and management of future smart buildings. In this paper, we investigate how BIM can contribute to the development of SBE. Since BIM is designed to host information of the building throughout its life cycle, our investigation has covered phases from architecture design to facility management. Firstly, we extend BIM for the design ph ase to provide material/device profiling and the information exchange interface for various smart objects. Next, we propose a three-layer verification framework to assist BIM users in identifying possible defects in their SBE design. For the post-construction phase, we have designed a facility management tool to provide advanced energy management of smart grid-connected SBEs , where smart objects, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) are deployed.},

  abstract = {A high demand for heating energy in winter, overheating in summer and visual discomfort are important issues in school buildings in the cold climate of China. This study presents the use of simulation--optimization tools to find the optimal trade-off between minimizing energy use for heating and lighting, reducing summer discomfort time and maximizing the Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDIavg, between 100 and 2000lx). Different spatial configurations were investigated, including a single-sided open corridor type, a single-sided enclosed corridor type and a double-sided corridor type school. The following passive design parameters were considered in the optimization analysis: orientation, room depth and corridor depth, window-to-wall ratio of different interfaces, glazing materials and shading types. The results of the optimization study show that the energy demand for heating and lighting can be reduced by 24--28\% and summer thermal discomfort by 9--23\% while the UDIavg (100--2000lx) can simultaneously increase by 15--63\%. Considering all three aspects, the double-sided enclosed corridor type performs best due to its energy performance while the one-sided enclosed corridor type is the least suitable for the cold climate because of its relatively poor visual comfort quality. In addition, the passive design parameters should be carefully considered as each spatial configuration has its own optimal passive design parameters.},

Existing information alignment methods typically require intensive manual effort and their ability to deal with the complex regulatory concepts in the regulations is limited. To address this gap, this paper proposes a deep learning method for IFC-regulation semantic information alignment. The proposed method uses a relation classification model to relate and align the IFC and regulatory concepts. The method uses a transformer-based model and leverages the definitions of the concepts and an IFC knowledge graph to provide additional contextual information and knowledge for improved classification and alignment. The proposed method was evaluated on IFC concepts from IFC 4 and regulatory concepts from different building codes and standards. The experimental results showed good information alignment performance.},

ChainPM extends Blockchain 2.0 with innovative indexing, query, and analysis function sets for key CPM data. Experimental results from a pilot study of a modular construction project showed that the information synchronization latency was reduced by 99.2\% to 99.8\%, and query and analytical functions worked equally well without network connections. ChainPM contributes to a novel trend of Blockchain 3.0 paradigms for CPM digital twins, emphasizing indexing key CPM data, combinatorial query, digital authorship, and fast response without downgrading the `single source of truth.' For practitioners, ChainPM addresses key barriers of Internet reliance and information delay to CPM digital twins.},

The basic idea is to fully utilize all diagnostic information in an information fusion way. The DBNs are developed based on a comprehensive survey of AHU fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods and fault patterns reported in three AHU FDD projects including NIST 6964, ASHRAE projects RP-1020 and RP-1312. The study is published in two parts. In the Part I, the methodology is described firstly. Four DBNs are developed to diagnose faults in fans, dampers, ducts, filters and sensors. There are 10 typical faults concerned and 14 fault detectors introduced. Evaluations are made using the experimental data from the ASHRAE Project RP-1312. Results show that the DBN-based method is effective in diagnosing faults even when the diagnostic information is uncertain and incomplete.},

To fully realize the Industry 4.0 vision, it is necessary to integrate multiple relevant DTs of a system according to a specific mission. This requires integrating all available data, information and knowledge related to the system across its entire lifecycle. It is a challenging task due to the high complexity of modern industrial systems. Semantic technologies such as ontology and knowledge graphs provide potential solutions by empowering DTs with augmented cognitive capabilities. The Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) concept has been recently proposed which reveals a promising evolution of the current DT concept towards a more intelligent, comprehensive, and full lifecycle representation of complex systems. This paper reviews existing studies relevant to the CDT concept, and further explores its definitions and key features. To facilitate CDT development, a reference architecture is proposed based on the RAMI4.0 and some other existing architectures. Moreover, some key enabling technologies and several application scenarios of CDT are introduced. The challenges and opportunities are discussed in the end to boost future studies.},

  abstract = {Simulation model is crucial for predicting the energy performance of building components, as it is closely related to the energy-saving evaluation and product promotion of various innovative technologies. As an emerging technology, the aerogel glazing system (AGS) is distinguished from other conventional glazing systems due to its nano-porous structure and scattering characteristics. However, the accuracy of different models for predicting the energy performance of AGS has not been exhaustively quantitatively investigated. In this study, based on the detailed dynamic heat transfer and solar radiation transmission calculation model (the detailed model) and the overall heat transfer coefficient K and the shading coefficient SC model (the K-SC model), the intermediate heat transfer and solar radiation transmission calculation model (the intermediate model) of AGS is proposed. The objective of the present study is to summarize the model features and quantitatively evaluate the simulation accuracy and speed of the three models. The experimental validation was conducted based on a test cell with AGS. The heat gain simulated by the three models under different weathers, seasons, and orientations was comprehensively analyzed. The results showed that the K-SC model has the largest error, especially on sunny days. The normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and the coefficient of variance of the root mean square error [CV(RMSE)] of the transmitted solar gain calculated by the K-SC model is -55.14\% and 80.99\%, respectively. Compared with the detailed model, the K-SC model may underestimate the energy-saving potential of AGS by at least 25.12\% in the cooling season and overestimate the energy-saving potential by at least 73.75\% in the heating season. The intermediate model has better accuracy than the K-SC model by 11.43--21.69\% in the cooling season and at least 23.21\% in the heating season. Meanwhile, the simulation speed of the intermediate model is faster than the detailed model by two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {In recent years, more and more existing building has an ever increasing requirement of retrofit, which has been developed from individual measure to combination package of multiple measures. It has become the challenging task for screening building multiple energy retrofit measures package (BMERMP). In this paper, a stepwise screening methodology for BMERMP is proposed considering economic and risk aspects, which integrates Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and Monte Carlo (MC) analysis. First of all, this paper puts forward a calculation reference table for energy saving retrofit potential. In addition, this paper also uses unit energy saving incremental cost (UESIC) to screen technology and suggests economic internal rate of returnÔºàEIRRÔºâas cost-benefit analysis index of BMERMP. Furthermore, the authors propose the concept of Value-at-Risk (VaR) as an effective measure to control the risk. The VaR for EIRR is determined by risk variation and can be obtained through MC simulation. Meanwhile, the study takes a commercial building for example, this building comprises 19 measures in initial BMERMP by energy diagnosis and the VaR of initial BMERMP is 97.6\%, which has a high risk. According to the ranking of UESIC value, when 4 high cost technologies are reduced, the VaR can be reduced to 0.07\%, then the economy of BMERMP is feasible and the risk is controllable. This paper provides a new perspective for the decision maker to select BMERMP.},

  abstract = {With ongoing advancements in information and communication technologies (ICTs) in all stages of the construction lifecycle, information from entities related to construction workflow (CW) can now be automatically collected. These implementations are point solutions, which require systematic integration to combine their information to enable a holistic picture of CW. The major barrier to such integration is information heterogeneity, where the information is collected from different systems under multiple contexts. Scholars in the construction domain have explored the use of ontology to solve the information-integration problem, although an ontology that both adequately represents the CW and integrates the digitalized information of CW via various systems and multiple contexts is currently missing from the existing literature. This research thus presents an ontology set for formalizing and integrating CW information within the digital construction context. The proposed digital construction ontologies (DiCon) are shared representations of construction domain knowledge that specify the terms and relations of CWs and their related information. We developed the DiCon based on a hybrid ontology development approach. The DiCon includes six modules: Entities, Processes, Information, Agents, Variables, and Contexts. The developed DiCon was further evaluated by approaches including automatic consistency checking, criteria-based evaluation, expert workshops, and task-based evaluation and involved two use cases by answering relevant competency questions via SPARQL queries. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that the DiCon ontologies are sufficient to represent domain knowledge and can formalize and integrate CW information within the digital construction context.},

However, the detailed electric power load data of various buildings in industrial parks are rarely available and accessible, which hinders the related studies. In this context, we present the electric power load data of 6 years (from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2021) for various types of buildings in an industrial park in Suzhou, China. The data are obtained from smart meters and have various time resolutions (i.e., 5\,minutes, 30\,minutes, and 1\,hour). This work describes the data collection, processing process, and different imputation methods. The high-resolution electric power load data can be used for various research tasks, including load prediction, load pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and demand response strategy development.},

  abstract = {Commercial buildings consume a lot of energy and contribute a significant part of greenhouse gas emission. Many energy-saving or green-building initiatives were compromised by equipment and human-related faults under the umbrella of poor facility management. Data-driven building energy management is a cost-effective approach to improve energy efficiency of commercial buildings, and gains more and more popularity worldwide with the deployment of smart metering systems. This paper developed a systematic process of using smart metering data to quantify building daily load profiles (i.e. energy consumption patterns) with a set of statistics, e.g. base load, peak load, rising time and so on. Then prediction models of these building load statistics are constructed from historical training data consisting of energy consumption, environment and holiday information. At last residuals of the prediction models are analyzed to form statistical control charts. As a result anomaly energy consumption could be detected by comparing the predicted statistics and observed ones, which will help building managers to locate problems just in time. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified through real-world data analysis and computational studies.},

To address this problem, this study adopted the graph-theory-based graph database technology to reveal hidden relationships within building information. A model-driven approach was developed to enable a full conversion of Industry Foundation Classes data into labeled property graph, which is referred to as IFC-Graph. The result shows that IFC-Graph can represent interconnected building information and reveal hidden relationships, supporting effective and efficient building information access and query.

  abstract = {The rapid development of rural tourism in north China is leading to the extensive growth of rural tourism buildings (RTBs), but the requirements for a comfortable indoor environment will further stimulate high energy consumption (EC) by RTBs. To promote the scientific design of RTBs in north China, three villages in Tianjin are used as research areas. A field survey is carried out, and two-in-one courtyards, triad courtyards and quadrangle courtyards (referred to as Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3, respectively) are found to be the dominant RTB types in the villages. Benchmark models of the three RTB types are extracted and built by using Rhino-Grasshopper, and the performance of the building types in terms of EC, indoor daylighting and thermal comfort is comprehensively considered. The Pareto-based multi-objective optimization tool of Octopus is applied to explore early designs of RTB shape and the window-to-wall ratio (WWR) for the above performance. The Pareto front solution sets and the best optimal solutions obtained by Utopian point method are presented for the three RTB types, and the suggested values for the design variables for the three RTB types are also displayed. A skylight-covered atrium design is found to help improve EC performance, and heating and cooling EC can be regarded as the key points of the RTB energy-saving design. Overall, the method contributes to the scientific design of RTBs, and the findings proposed herein can provide guidance for RTB development in north China and other areas with similar conditions.},

  abstract = {It has become crucial to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of building loads (peak cooling load, peak heating load, annual cooling demand and annual heating demand) for meeting the risk assessment of building energy planning. Therefore, a new Monte Carlo (MC) method based on building performance simulation (BPS) is proposed to solve the problem of building loads forecasting at planning phase. Furthermore, the sensitivity of building loads is examined using two global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods, including meta modeling method based on tree Gaussian process (TGP) and regression method based on standard regression coefficient (SRC). Finally, a case study of office building is conducted. The results show that the MC method constructed by the combination of R language platform and EnergyPlus software can generate models rapidly and simulate accu\- rately building loads. Note that it is necessary to assess the stability of results as a function of sample size from uncertainty analysis in applying the MC method into building loads assessment. The TGP-based GSA method is applicable to identify and analyze key variables affecting building loads. It is recommended that at least two inherently different GSA methods should be applied to provide robust sensitivity results. Moreover, this study also provides insight on building energy planning and energy conservation design according to the results of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for case study.},

  abstract = {While it is possible to check the energy performance of a given building by means of several available methods, the inverse problem of determining the optimum configuration given a desired performance is more difficult to solve. In the Mediterranean region this problem is more complex due to the following two reasons: the air-conditioning load is as important as the heating load, and the energy needs depend on a high number of architectural parameters which have different, even contradictory, effects on summer and winter loads. In this paper we present an optimization algorithm that couples pseudo-random optimization techniques, the genetic algorithms (GA), with a simplified tool for building thermal evaluation (CHEOPS) for the purpose of minimizing the energy consumption of Mediterranean buildings. Since increasing the energy performance usually requires the use of special devices resulting in a high construction cost, we also propose to use GA for the purpose of economical optimization.
