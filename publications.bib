  abstract = {With the growing need for precise campus electricity management, understanding load patterns is crucial for improving energy efficiency and optimizing energy use. However, detailed electricity load data for campus buildings and their internal equipment is often lacking, hindering research. This paper introduces an energy consumption monitoring dataset from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) campus in Hong Kong, comprising data from over 1400 meters across more than 20 buildings and collected over two and a half years. Using the Brick Schema curation strategy, raw data was curated into a research-ready format. This dataset supports various research tasks, including load pattern recognition, fault detection, demand response strategies, and load forecasting.},
